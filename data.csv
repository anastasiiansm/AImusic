English,1,Last Night,person,Morgan Wallen,Last Night by Morgan Wallen,"[Intro]
Last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet

[Verse 1]
No way it was our last night I kissed your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talkin' 'bout life, goin' sip for sip
Yeah, you, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me

[Chorus]
I know that last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)

[Verse 2]
No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your mama, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah, my, my friends say, ""Let her go""
Your friends say, ""What the hell?""
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can't remember everything we said, but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)

[Outro]
I know you said this time you really weren't comin' back again
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)",0,2023,"Country

We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn

[Pre-Chorus]
Mm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered I

[Chorus]
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can

[Post-Chorus]
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

[Verse 2]
Paint my nails cherry-red
Match the roses that you left
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said

Ooh, I didn't wanna leave you, baby, I didn't wanna fight
Started to cry, but then remembered I

I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should

[Chorus]
I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone

[Verse 2]
I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one will

[Chorus]
I might (I)
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone

[Bridge]
I did it all for love (Love)
I did it all on no drugs (Drugs)
I did all of this sober
I did it all for us, oh
I did it all for love (Love)
I did all of this on no drugs (Drugs)
I did all of this sober
Don't you know I did it all for us? (I'm gon' kill your ass tonight)

[Chorus]
Oh, I just killed my ex (My ex, oops), not the best idea (Idea)
Killed his girlfriend next, how'd I get here? (He left me no choice)
I just killed my ex (My ex), I still love him though (I do)

English,4,Anti-Hero,person,Taylor Swift,Anti-Hero by Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Bridge]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees
[Chorus]
It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero",0,2023,"Rock

(Just can't believe this, man)
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I think about it when I hold you
When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe
And I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

[Bridge: Mario Winans, The Weeknd, Both]
Did he touch you better than me? (Touch you better than me)
Did he watch you fall asleep? (Watch you fall asleep)
Did you show him all those things that you used to do to me?
If you're better off that way (Better off that way)
There ain't more that I can say (More that I can say)
Just go on and do your thing and don't come back to me

[Verse 3: 21 Savage]
Woah, woah, woah, 21
Had me crushin', I was cuffin' like the precinct
How you go from housewife to a sneaky link?
Got you riding 'round in all type of Benzes and Rovers
Girl, you used to ride in the rinky-dink
I'm the one put you in Eliantte (On God)
Fashion Nova model, I put you on the runway (On God)
You was rockin' Coach bags, got you Chane'-ne'
Side bitch in Frisco, I call her my Bay-bae (21)
I got a girl, but I still feel alone (On God)
If you playin' me that mean my home ain't home (On God)
Havin' nightmares of goin' through your phone (21)
Can't even record, you got me out my zone

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creepin', please don't let it show

'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
[Outro: 21 Savage & The Weeknd]
If you creepin', just don't let me find out (On God)
Get a hotel, never bring 'em to the house (On God)

English,7,Die For You,feat,The Weeknd & Ariana Grande,Die For You by The Weeknd & Ariana Grande,"[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you (Yeah)
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfеct
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh

[Chorus: Both, Ariana Grande, The Weeknd]
Even though we'rе goin' through it (Ah)
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you (Ooh, ooh)
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us (Distance and the time)
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you (I would die for you)
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
I'm findin' ways to stay concentrated on what I gotta do
But, baby boy, it's so hard 'round you
And yes, I'm blamin' you
And you know I can't fake it, now or never
And you insinuatin' that you think we might be better
Better me and you
Yeah, I know you do

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect (Mm)
And I know you deserve it
I can't walk away

[Chorus: Both, Ariana Grande, The Weeknd]
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you (Me) feel alone
Just know that I would die for you (I would die for you)
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you (I would die for you, uh)
Baby, I would die for you, yeah (I would die for you)
[Bridge: The Weeknd]
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Even though we're goin' through it (Ooh)
And it makes you feel alone (No, no)
Just know that I would die for you (No)
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

English,8,Fast Car,person,Luke Combs,Fast Car by Luke Combs,"[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did

[Refrain]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

Ooh
I think I know

[Verse 1]
I'll touch that fire for you
I do that three, four times again, I testify for you
I told that lie, I'd kill that bitch
I do what all of them around you scared to do, I'm not
Long as you juggin' out here for me, I got it
Mobbin', schemin', lootin', hide your bodies
Long as you dreamin' 'bout me, ain't no problem
I don't got nobody, just with you right now
Tell the truth, I look better under you

[Chorus]
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do
I can't lose when I'm with you
I can't just snooze and miss the moment
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do, you do

[Verse 2]
In a droptop ride with you, I feel like Scarface (Scarface)
Like that white bitch with the bob, I'll be your main one (Your main one)
Lеt's take this argument back up to my place (My placе)
Sex remind you I'm nonviolent, I'm your day one (Day one)
We ain't have shit yet, it was magic, yeah
Smash and grab shit, yeah
Nasty habits take a hold when you not here
Ain't a home when you not here
Hard to grow when you not here, I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do, you do

[Bridge]
Main one ridin'
How you frontin' on me and I'm the main one tryin'?
How you blame it on me and you the main one lyin'?
How you threatenin' to leave and I'm the main one cryin'?
Just tryna be your everything
Main one ridin'
How you frontin' on me and I'm the main one tryin'?
How you blame it on me and you the main one lyin'?
How you threatenin' to leave and I'm the main one cryin'?

[Chorus]
I can't lose when I'm with you (Like you, like you)
How can I snooze and miss the moment? (Like you)
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do
I can't lose when I'm with you (Like you)
How can I snooze and miss the moment? (Like you)
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do, you do

English,13,Something In The Orange,person,Zach Bryan,Something In The Orange by Zach Bryan,"[Verse 1]
It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

[Verse 2]
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

[Chorus]
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

[Verse 3]
I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

[Chorus]
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

[Chorus]
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around

[Intro: 21 Savage & Young Nudy]
Go buy a zip of weed, hit the club
Pay for 'bout ten niggas to get in
We crunk, lit, in this bitch, yeah
Know we walk around the world
Steppin', not givin a damn 'bout where our feet land at, yeah
Get your ass mushed, smooshed (6ix)
Yeah, 21, the biggest
Put a nigga in the chicken wing, pussy

[Chorus: Drake & 21 Savage]
21, can you do somethin' for me? (21)
Can you hit a lil' rich flex for me? (21)
And 21, can you do somethin' for me? (21, 21)
Drop some bars to my pussy ex for me
Then 21 (21), can you do somethin' for me? (Yeah)
Can you talk to the opps necks for me? (Okay)
21, do your thing 21, do your thing (21)
Do your thing, 21, do your thing

[Verse: 21 Savage]
Yellow diamonds in the watch, this shit cost a lot
Never send a bitch your dot, that's how you get shot
I DM in Vanish Mode, I do that shit a lot
Took her panties off and this bitch thicker than the plot
All my exes ain't nothin', them hoes busted
If my opps ain't rappin', they ass duckin'
You ain't ready to pull the trigger, don't clutch it
I know you on your period, baby, can you suck it?
I'm a savage (21)
Smack her booty in Magic (21, 21)
I'll slap a pussy nigga with a ratchet (Pussy)
I might slap a tracker on his whip and get the addy (Pussy)
Don't call me on Christmas Eve, bitch, call your daddy (21)
Bitch, call your uncle (21), bitch, don't call me (21)
Always in my ear, your ho a flea (Fuck)
Why my opps be posting guns and only use they feet? (21)
Paid like an athlete, I got—

[Segue: Drake]
All you hoes, all of you hoes need to remember who y'all talkin' to
It's a Slaughter Gang CEO
I got dick for you if I'm not workin', girl
If I'm busy then fuck no
You need to find you someone else to call
When your bank account get low, you need to find you someone—

Sticks and stones, chrome on chrome
That's just what a nigga on
Internet clones, got 'em kissin' through the phone
Pussies cliquin' up so they don't feel alone, ayy
Nan' nigga seein' me, I'm Young Money CMB
I used to roll with CMG, the house is not a BNB
The bad bitches waitin' on a nigga like I'm PND
I'm steady pushin' P, you niggas pushing PTSD
I told her ass to kiss me in the club, fuck a TMZ
I used to want a GMC, when Woe was doing B&E
We revvin' up and goin' on a run like we DMC
I layup with her for a couple days, then it's BRB
You rappers love askin' if I fucked, when you know we did
When you know we did
She came in heels but she left out on her cozy shit
Ayy, I'm livin' every twenty-four like Kobe did
Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P. to 8
Swear this shit is gettin' ate, I'm on ten for the cake
Get a lot of love from twelve, but I don't reciprocate
Fifty-one division stay patrollin' when it's late
21 my addy, so the knife is on the gate
All the dawgs eatin' off a Baccarat plate
Niggas see Drake and they underestimate
Take it from a vet', that's a rookie ass mistake, ayy
[Outro: Drake & Young Nudy]
Ah, what? What?
Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit

English,15,As It Was,person,Harry Styles,As It Was by Harry Styles,"[Intro]
Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you

[Verse 1]
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
Answer the phone
""Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?""
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

[Bridge]
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

We've been swingin’ and missin'
It ain't broke yet, but damn, it needs fixin’
Been a while since your kiss felt like kissin'
It's just different

[Pre-Chorus]
We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we been together
Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we’re better
Off with all this, but we’re caught in-between

[Chorus]
A rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
That’s when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mеnds or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place

[Verse 2]
For thе record (Shit)
Throwin' in the towel takes some effort
So I’d rather ride it out for better weather
Together

[Chorus]
Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
That's when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place

[Pre-Chorus]
We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we been together
Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we're better
Off with all this, but we're caught in-between

A rock and a hard place
Tears rollin' down your face
As I walked out that door
That's when I lost it

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil
[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)

English,19,Thinkin' Bout Me,person,Morgan Wallen,Thinkin' Bout Me by Morgan Wallen,"[Verse 1]
Don't know where you at, don't know where you've been
Don't know nothin' 'bout that boy you're into
Don't feel bad for you but I feel bad for him
And all the hell you gon' be puttin' him through
Probably tell him we're a burnt out flame
Probably tell him that I ain't been on your mind
How I ain't nothin' but a long gone thing
You can cuss my name, but baby, don't you lie

[Chorus]
When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?

[Verse 2]
Do you hide your phone? Did you change my name?
When he wants to go to our go-to place
Do you tell him you can't? Then go out of your way
To be somewhere, any damn where I ain't

[Chorus]
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?

[Bridge]
Don't know where you at
But girl, I know where you oughta be

[Chorus]
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missing my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Yeah, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout me?",0,2023,"Country

Take a look inside your heart, is there any room for me?
I won't have to hold my breath till you get down on one knee
Because you only want to hold me when I'm looking good enough
Did you ever feel me? Would you ever picture us?
Every time I pull my hair, well, it's only out of fear
That you'll find me ugly and one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying? It was never even love
Did you ever want me? Was I ever good enough?

[Chorus: PinkPantheress]
Thе-the boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doеsn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy
The boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy

[Post-Chorus: PinkPantheress]
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough

[Verse 2: Ice Spice & PinkPantheress]
He say that I'm good enough (Yeah), grabbin' my duh-duh-duh
Thinkin' 'bout shit that I shouldn't've (Huh)
So I tell him there's one of me, he makin' fun of me (Ha-ha)
His girl is a bum to me (Grrah)
Like that boy is a cap
Sayin' he home, but I know where he at, like
Bet he blowin' her back
Thinkin' 'bout me 'cause he know that it's fat (Damn)
And it been what it been (Huh)
Callin' his phone like, ""Yo, send me a pin""
Duckin' my shit, 'cause he know what I'm on (Grrah)
But when he hit me, I'm not gon' respond (Grrah)
But I don't sleep enough without you
And I can't eat enough without you (Huh)
If you don't speak, does that mean we're through? (Huh)
Don't like sneaky shit that you do (Grrah)

[Chorus: PinkPantheress]
The-the boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy
The boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy

English,21,Favorite Song,person,Toosii,Favorite Song by Toosii,"[Intro: Tatiana Manaois & Toosii]
But nobody's
Gonna make you change what you probably
Don't like anyway 'bout you darlin'
So you might as well
Hmm-mmm
Be somebody
Who can make you face what you're guardin'
Open up the gates where your heart is
And just be yourself 
Yeah

[Chorus: Toosii]
I'm on the stage right now, singin' your favorite song
Look in the crowd, and you're nowhere to be found as they sing along
I say, ""You look good without no make-up, no lashes, even better when you wake up"" (Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 1: Toosii]
I see the look on your face, I see you're hidin' the hate
I see you're lookin' for someone to scoop you right off of your feet
You want to ride in the Wraith
You want to go out on dates
You want somebody to come bring you flowers
Someone to talk to for hours
Wash your back while y'all sit in the shower (Yeah)
Someone to tell you, ""You're beautiful""
Someone to tell you and mean it
Someone to tell you, ""I love you"" everyday and don't got a reason
You want someone to bring you peace (Uh)
Someone to help you sleep (Yeah)
Someone to pick you up when you're feelin' down, feelin' lonely

[Pre-Chorus: Toosii]
Need somebody who can make it better
Somebody who can open up those gates
Open up those gates to your heart
Only if you'll let me

[Chorus: Toosii]
I'm on the stage right now, singin' your favorite song
Look in the crowd, and you're nowhere to be found as they sing along
I say, ""You look good without no make-up, no lashes, even better when you wake up"" (Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2: Toosii]
I see the look on your face, I see you're lookin' for peace
I see you're tired of the hurt, tired of the pain, tired of the nights where you can't get no sleep
I see you're tired thinkin' 'bout if he cheat
See you tired thinkin' 'bout if you're leavin'
See you tired of bein' so tired
And you're damn sure ain't gettin' even

[Pre-Chorus: Toosii]
Need somebody who can make it better
Somebody who can open up those gates
Open up those gates to your heart
Only if you'll let me

[Chorus: Toosii]
I'm on the stage right now, singin' your favorite song
Look in the crowd, and you're nowhere to be found as they sing along
I say, ""You look good without no make-up, no lashes, even better when you wake up"" (Oh, oh, oh)
[Outro: Tatiana Manaois]
Gonna make you change what you probably
Don't like anyway 'bout you darlin'
So you might as well
Be somebody
Who can make you face what you're guardin'
Open up the gates where your heart is

English,22,Thought You Should Know,person,Morgan Wallen,Thought You Should Know by Morgan Wallen,"[Verse 1]
What's goin' on, Mama? Somethin' just dawned on me
I ain't been home in some months
Been chasin' songs and women, makin' some bad decisions
God knows I'm drinkin' too much

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I know you've been worryin' 'bout me
You've been losin' sleep since '93

[Chorus]
I thought you should know, that all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must've finally made their way on through
I thought you should know, I got me a new girl down there in Jefferson City, and
She lets me fish whenever I want to
Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from, still your only damn son, can you believe I'm on the radio?
Just thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know

[Verse 2]
Oh, by the way, Mama, didn't mean to ramblе on ya
How's everything back at home?
Yеah, how's that garden comin'? Is Dad still doin' dumb shit?
And how'd he keep you this long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm sorry that I called you so late
I just miss you, but anyways

[Chorus]
I thought you should know, that all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must've finally made their way on through
I thought you should know, I got me a new girl down there in Jefferson City, and
She lets me fish whenever I want to
Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from, still your only damn son, can you believe I'm on the radio?
Just thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know

[Bridge]
Yeah, I know you've been worryin' 'bout me
You've been losin' sleep since '93

[Chorus]
I thought you should know, that all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must've finally made their way on through
I thought you should know, that I really like this girl down in Jefferson City, and
It turns out she's a lot like you
Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from, still your only damn son, the bus is leavin' so I gotta roll
Just thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know

And every night when I close my eyes, before I say ""Amen""

Durkio told me he been on some positive shit, yeah, yeah
Lately, I just wanna show up and body some shit, yeah, yeah
Always been a lil' mathematician, lately, it's cash I'm gettin'
Got me losin' count of these bags, I've been movin' too fast
Hard times don't last, 'member when cops harassed
Talkin' out my ass, boy, you ain't shit but a bitch with a badge

[Chorus: Choir & Lil Durk]
All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)
All this time (All this time)
Never thought I would make it out (Never thought I'd make it out)
They couldn't break me, they couldn't break mе (No, no)
They couldn't take me, thеy couldn't take me (No)
All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I decided I had to finish
But the media called me a menace
I done sat with the mayor and politicians, I'm tryna change the image
You can't blame my past no more, I come from the trenches
Some said I'd never be a superstar, but I know I'm different (No, no, no)
I'm The Voice, but the system ain't give me a choice
Know some people that's still unemployed
I know a felon who tryna get FOID
Child support your only support
For a visit, I'm goin' through courts
Went to jail, they was chainin' me up
And you know that I'm famous as fuck
See, how you gon' joke about stimulus?
But they really had came in the clutch
I know some kids wanna hurt theyself
Stop tryna take drugs, I refer to myself
Tryna better myself, tryna better my health but

[Chorus: Choir, Lil Durk & J. Cole]
All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
First-generation ghetto nigga
Cole world, hello niggas
Made it out the city with my head on straight
Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out
Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out
And the shit that I spit out
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO
And how a nigga put a hit out
And another one, and, and another one
I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me
But I'm really in front of them
Now some of them fumblin' they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself
This shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm runnin' long distance, all pistons firin'
I been stuck between maybe retirin'
And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days seein' rappers be dyin'
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy
Now I'm on the phone, searchin' lil' buddy name
Got to playin' his tunes
All day in my room, thinkin', ""Damn
This shit wicked, to get they names buzzin'
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb""
And media thirsty for clicks
I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
It's simple, it's the principle
On any tempo, I'm invincible
Don't even rap, I just vent to you
I rather that than an interview most days
Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho phase
Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage
I pray all of my dawgs stay so paid
And the only thing that kill 'em is old age

[Verso 1: Pedro Tovar & Peso Pluma]
Compa, ¿qué le parece esa morra?
La que anda bailando sola me gusta pa' mí
¡Bella! Ella sabe que está buena
Que todos andan mirándola cómo baila
Me acerco y le tiro todo un verbo
Tomamos tragos sin peros, solo tentación
Le dije: ""Voy a conquistar tu familia, que en unos días vas a ser mía""
Me dijo que estoy muy loco, pero le gusta
Que ningún vato como yo actúa

[Interludio: Pedro Tovar & Peso Pluma]
Y ahí te va, mija
Y pura Doble P, viejo
Así nomás, compa Pedro
Puro Eslabon Armado
Pa' las plebitas
¡Cha-chau!

[Verso 2: Peso Pluma & Pedro Tovar]
No soy un vato que tiene varo
Pero hablando del corazón, te cumplo todo
Me agarró, pegadito dе su mano
Mi compa ni se la creyó, que al pasar fui yo
Su cuеrpo, juro por Dios, que era tan perfecta
Su cinturita como modelo
Sus ojos desde el principio me enamoraron
A ella le gusto y a mí me gusta",0,2023,"Country

Karma is that girl, like (Grrah)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's comin' back around

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing likе a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

[Verse 2: Ice Spice, Ice Spice & Taylor Swift]
Karma is your chеck's 'boutta bounce (Damn)
Karma is a fire in your house (Grrah)
And she 'boutta pop up unannounced (Like)
And she never leavin' you alone (Damn)
Watch her put ya opps on a throne (Damn)
Got you wavin' pretty white flags, feenin' for that cash
Thinkin' it'll save ya, now you switchin' up your behavior
It's okay, baby, you ain't gotta worry, karma never gets lazy
So, I keep my head up, my bread up, I won't let up (Never)
Promise that you'll never endeavor with none lesser (Ever, ever)
I be draggin' that wagon, karma is a beauty winning that pageant, grrah

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Ice Spice, Taylor Swift & Ice Spice]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Damn)
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that (Grrah)

[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)
[Breakdown: Taylor Swift, Ice Spice, Taylor Swift & Ice Spice]
'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattlin' your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
And karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit (Facts)
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Ice Spice, Taylor Swift & Ice Spice]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)
Karma is a god (Damn)
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat

English,30,Vampire,person,Olivia Rodrigo,Vampire by Olivia Rodrigo,"[Verse 1]
Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

[Chorus]
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire

[Verse 2]
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better

[Chorus]
I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire

[Bridge]
(Ah)
You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand

[Chorus]
I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker

(Ooh, Dunk Rock)

[Chorus]
Fuck you mean?
Young Gunna Wunna back, callin' me splurge
Watch me jump right off the curb
Bentley Spur fly like a bird
Spin on the first and the third
Solid, I'm keepin' my word
Can't be my equal, I don't know what you heard
Crank up the foreign, I swerve
Keep me a stick if they purge

[Bridge]
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha

[Verse]
Fuck you mean?
Young Gunna Wunna, they workin' my nerves
I'm about to pour up some syrup
Fucking this bitch like a perv'
Smack from the back, grab her perm
Ice, the berg, uh, shittin' on all you lil' turds
Can't take that dick, wait your turn
In my own lane, we can't merge
Suck with no hands, you can learn
Let's see how much you can earn
Watch me go big likе the Worm
And I ain't smokin' no sherm
I'm in this bitch with P Liity
QP, QP-ski
All of my bitches is prеtty, they showin' they titties, it's up to the ceilin'
I let her run through a million, I rock with her really, let's fuck on a billion
I'ma get down to the gritty, then fuck up the city, the home of the villains
Ecstasy, wonderful feelin'
Smoke out the pound when I'm chillin'
Trappin', I made me a killin'
Look, I got everybody wishin'
I hope you play your position
I don't want nobody listenin'
I see the ho with precision
Get rich my only decision

[Chorus]
Fuck you mean?
Young Gunna Wunna back, callin' me splurge
Watch me jump right off the curb
Bentley Spur fly like a bird
Spin on the first and the third
Solid, I'm keepin' my word
Can't be my equal, I don't know what you heard
Crank up the foreign, I swerve
Keep me a stick if they purge

Meet me at midnight

[Verse 1]
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia

[Pre-Chorus]
I been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh, yeah)
You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh, yeah)
All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
I feel
The lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

[Verse 2]
All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me)
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see (Only kinda girl they see)
Is a one-night or a wife

[Pre-Chorus]
I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh, yeah)
They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah)
But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
I feel
The lavender haze creepin' up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

[Post-Chorus]
That lavender haze

[Bridge]
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk (Get it off my desk)
Talk your talk and go viral

Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk

I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior, oh
If I only talk to God when I need a favor?
But, God, I need a favor

[Verse 1]
I know amazin' grace, but I ain't been livin' them words
Swear I spend most Sundays
Drunk off my ass than I have at church
Hard cover King James
Only been savin' dust on the nightstand
And I don't know what to say
By the time I fold my hands

[Chorus]
I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior, oh
If I only talk to God when I need a favor?
But, God, I need a favor

[Post-Chorus]
Amen, amen

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I owe you more than one
And beggars can't be choosers
But I'll pay for all I've done
Just pleasе don't let me lose hеr

[Chorus]
I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior, oh

But, God, I need a favor

Amen, amen
Amen, amen

Hangin' in there just barely
Throwin' up prayers like Hail Marys
If You're still there, Lord, spare me
Oh, my God, oh, my God, Hail Mary
Hangin' in there just barely
Throwin' up prayers like Hail Marys
If You're still there, Lord, spare me
Oh, my God, oh, my God, Hail Mary

I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer

Baby, you can find me under the lights
Diamonds under my eyes
Turn the rhythm up, don't you wanna just
Come along for the ride?
Ooh, my outfit so tight
You can see my heartbeat tonight
I can take the heat, baby, best believe
That's the moment I shine

[Refrain]
'Cause every romance shakes and it bends
Don't give a damn
When the night's here, I don't do tears
Baby, no chance

[Pre-Chorus]
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

[Chorus]
Watch me dance, dance the night away
My hеart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dancе, dance the night away (Uh-huh)
I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place

[Verse 2]
Lately, I been movin' close to the edge
Still be lookin' my best
I stay on the beat, you can count on me
I ain't missin' no steps

Baby, no chance

When my heart breaks (They never see it, never see it)
When my world shakes (I feel alive, I feel alive)
I don't play safe (Ooh), don't you know about me? (Uh-huh)

[Bridge]
Even when the tears are flowin', they're diamonds on my face
I'll still keep the party goin', not one hair out of place (Yes, I can)
Even when the tears are flowin', they're diamonds on my face (Yes, I can, yes, I can)
I'll still keep the party goin', not one hair out of place

If your kiss turned me to stone
I'd be a statue standing tall in ancient Rome
And if your touch shattered me like glass
I’d be in pieces trying to make the breaking last

[Pre-Chorus]
If it took one look to turn my days to night
At least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes

[Chorus]
There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you’d be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway

[Verse 2]
I know just tryin' to write a song
I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong
And well, I guess what I'm tryin' to say
Is there ain't words been made could shoulder so much weight

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you turned your back on me and walked away
Not a thing about the way I feel would change

[Chorus]
There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I’d love you anyway

I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time

[Verse 2]
I know I got me some problems
About a thousand memories I gotta forgеt
But if I'm gonna solve 'em
Baby, I'll take all thе help I can get

[Pre-Chorus]
If you ain't gonna kiss me
Then I'll take some whiskey, some Grizzly
Nicotine amphetamines too
You want me to stop some of that
Or you want me to stop lovin' you?
Hey, what you want me to do?

[Chorus]
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time

[Post-Chorus]
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you

[Bridge]
I ain't no Superman, I'm just the way I am
If I'm gonna move on, then I need me somethin' in my hand
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
And if you ain't comin' back
[Chorus]
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time

[Post-Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, two
(Metro)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Future]
Drank and dope turned me to a superhero, yeah, yeah
Hit that pill, turned me to a superhero, yeah, yeah (Super)
Boominati turned me to a superhero, yeah, yeah (Metro)
(If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)
I'm on that dope again, I'm on that flow again
Switch up the flow again, yeah, yeah (Switch it)
Fly than a parachute, grippin' that pole again
I'm on that oil again, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Future]
Candy in the cup, gotta get paid (What?)
King of the streets (Yeah), young nigga made
Sprayin' up the crowd (What?), take it to thе grave
Ain't havin' problems, I'm sippin' the Barrе
Shoutout to Dallas, my bitch is a star
Nigga get rich, better take it to war (Yeah)
Piss on your casket, shoot at your broad
Do you somethin' nasty, roll you in a 'gar
Bitch get graphic, fuck me in a car
I get you a brand new Rollie tomorrow
I put a brand new Rollie on your arm
Ain't movin' slow, but I'm still on oil (Skrrt)
Tennis bracelets and they came with the frost (Frost)
Cuban links all the way up to your jaw (All the way up)
Step up the swag when I step on a broad

[Verse 2: Future]
Two dollar half, ooh, that's the cheapest one
Stackin' these hundreds up, like coupons
Told you from the begin, upper echelon
I get to stackin' up, I'm untouchable
I get to represent, money multiple
I'm at the top of the charts, unapproachable
Bread by the loaf, turbo the motor
Tic-Tac-Toe, kill another vulture
Sellin' the bowls, bitch do yoga
I deserve awards, servin' these boulders
A hundred grand large when I shop, that's the total
Fill up the garage, bitch, I'm a mogul
Ain't no facadin', ain't no fugazi
I jump it off, I get paid
Drop top Royce, I'm goin' crazy
I push off, smokin' on haze (Woah)
Not tryna floss, Cartier shades

Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain

Soon as you up, these niggas wanna bring you down
The weight of the world sit on my shoulders, hold the crown
I ain't got a cape so I can't save you now
Niggas wanna hate (Yeah), would rather see you drown (Drown)
And the world keep spinnin' (Yeah)
Like I'm the only one in it (Am I the only one?) Why?

What you, ooh, uh, what you do?
Made a move, could've made a move
If I knew I'd be with you
Is it too late to pursue?

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
I bite my tongue, it's a bad habit
Kinda mad that I didn't take a stab at it
Thought you were too good for me, my dear
Never gave me time of day, my dear
It's okay, things happen for
Reasons that I think are sure, yeah

Please say to me (Please just say to me)
If you still want it
I wish you wouldn't play with me
I wanna know (I wanna know)

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
Can I bite your tongue like my bad habit?
Would you mind if I tried to make a pass at it?
No, you're not too good for me, my dear
Funny you come back to me, my dear
It's okay, things happen for
Reasons that I can't ignore, yeah

You can't surprise a Gemini (I wish I knew)
I'm everywhere, I'm cross-eyed, and (I wish I knew you wanted me)
Now that you're back, I can't decide (I wish I knew)
If I decide if you're invited (I wish I knew you wanted me)
You always knew the way to wow me
Fuck around, get tongue-tied, and
I turn it on, I make it rowdy
Then carry on, but I'm not hidin'
You grabbin' me hard 'cause you know what you found
It's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: Steve Lacy, Steve Lacy & Fousheé]
You can't surprise a Gemini
But you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
I knew you'd come back around
'Cause you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
Let's fuck in the back of the mall, lose control
Go stupid, go crazy, babe
I know I'll be in your heart 'til the end
You'll miss me, don't beg me, babe",0,2023,"Pop

Spanish,40,La Bebe,feat,Yng Lvcas x Peso Pluma,La Bebe by Yng Lvcas x Peso Pluma,"[Letra de ""La Bebe (Remix)""]

[Pre-Coro: Peso Pluma & Yng Lvcas]
Desafánate, loca, luego empápate
De mi cuerpo mójate, usted sabe, en el Benz, móntate
¿Qué lo que? Mi bebé en el Mercedes-Benz
Las estrellas en el techo, ya estelar se fue
Pero sabes tú que esta noche estás pa' mí
Ven, trépate encima 'e mí, manda la ubi, paso por ti

[Coro: Yng Lvcas]
Quierе que le ponga música
Pa' que bailе hasta abajo la bebé
Bebimos par de botellas
Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer
Quiere que le ponga música
Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé
Bebimos par de botellas
Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer

[Verso 1: Yng Lvcas]
No se le ha olvidado cómo la pasamos
Fuimos a la disco y los dos bailamos pegados
Como perros pegados, besos y un par de tragos
Se quedó a mi lado y dijo: ""Creo me he enamorado""
Ella fuma, ella toma
Es diablita, chiquita, pero picosa
Me encanta cuando el pantalón me lo roza
A ella le encanta, se ve en su cara lo goza

[Puente: Peso Pluma]
Tiene novio y no se comporta
Me dice: ""Tranqui, que la relación 'tá rota""
Nuestros cuerpo' chocan y chocan
Se juntan las boca', los leggings le ahorcan

[Coro: Yng Lvcas]
Quiere que le ponga música
Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé
Bebimos par de botellas
Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer
Quiere que le ponga música
Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé
Bebimo' par de botella'
Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer

[Verso 2: Yng Lvcas & Peso Pluma]
Ayer, ayer te movías muy bien, muy bien
Se impregnó el olor de Chanel
'Tamos mil grados Fahrenheit
Está buena y de cara bonita
Le pones música y solita se excita
Pa' la fiesta nunca se limita
Par de amigas, completa la cuadrilla
Pero tú, mamá, sabes, me mamas
Loca, ven pa'cá, pégate hasta atrás
Nos vamos tú y yo en un viaje fugaz
Interestelar, comerte toda
Fumaremos los dos marihuana
En el cuarto, en la azotea y en mi cama
Nena, creo te llaman, contesta mañana
Que no se apague la llama
En el AMG escuchando ""Ruedas y Cristal""
Quemando veneno que me trae volando, ma
Besito a la Barbie, pa' que baile pega'o
Ojitos chinitos como puki de Taiwán, -án
Como puki de Taiwán
Como puki de Taiwán
Esa pussy me la como cuando yo quiera, mami, ma
[Pre-Coro: Peso Pluma & Yng Lvcas]
Desafánate, loca, luego empápate (Hasta abajo la bebé)
De mi cuerpo mójate, usted sabe, en el Benz, móntate (Hasta abajo la bebé)
¿Qué lo que? Mi bebé en el Mercedes-Benz (Hasta abajo la bebé)
Las estrellas en el techo, ya estelar se fue (Eh)

[Coro: Yng Lvcas]
Uy, quiere que le ponga música
Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé
Bebimos par de botellas
Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer
Quiere que le ponga música
Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé
Bebimos par de botellas
Y aun así recuerda que lo hicimo' ayer

English,41,Golden Hour,person,JVKE,Golden Hour by JVKE,"[Verse 1]
It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listenin' to Blonde
Fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish
No Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?""
Got no alibi

[Pre-Chorus]
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

[Chorus]
Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast
Burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?

[Pre-Chorus]
For the love of my life
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

[Chorus]
Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

English,42,Religiously,person,Bailey Zimmerman,Religiously by Bailey Zimmerman,"[Verse 1]
I went lookin' at pictures I didn't wanna see
They brought back memories
You look happy, I guess, got the life that you wanted
But it ain't with me
You would think by now that I wouldn't care
It's been a couple years and, yeah, I've had my share
Of other broken-up hearts, but I only shed real tears over ours

[Chorus]
And now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Prayin' just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me
Religiously

[Verse 2]
Remember watchin' you play me our song on guitar
I thought I'd marry you
Act like I'm happier now, but all of my friends know
That ain't the truth
And lately life's been good to me
Mama's healthy and I'm helpin' out the whole family
Lotta people know my name, I made a little change
But that don't mean nothin'

[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Prayin' hard just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me
Religiously

[Bridge]
You brought me to God and I put you through hell
You were all about us, I was all about myself
What kind of man would lose a woman like that?
If my soul could be forgiven, I would give it all back

[Chorus]
Now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Beggin' God just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously

Lovin' tonight (Ooh)
Give me the feelin', so right (You gotta motherfuckin' feel this shit, boy)
Give me your lovin' (BanBwoi, I want your love)
Give me your lovin' (Woah, give me your lovin')

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I got feelings for you
Hope you ain't lovin' the crew
How many bodies you got?
Pray it ain't more than a few
Know that you dealt with some lames
When you was young and in school
He had to pop your cherry
But I got it wet like a pool
She got a new G-Wag'
She wanna hit Highlight Room and show it off
Got a new body, girl, show it off
This a Brazilian, I know it's soft
Toned up and she got a six-pack
Look like she used to play volleyball
American Express, you can have it all
Code to the safe, you can have it all
Fuck your main pagе, what's your Finsta? I wanna know the real you
You started dancin' to pay your tuition, girl, I wanna know what you been through
You want a boutiquе or you wanna sell hair, just let me know what you into
If you out in public and he want your number, just tell him, ""My nigga'll spin you""

[Chorus: Drake]
The way you make me feel these days
Somethin' gettin' dropped for you, baby girl
Smoke a nigga top for you, baby girl
Burn somebody block for you
The way you make me feel these days
Comin' out my body for you, baby girl
Wipe him like he snotty for you, baby girl
Comin' out my body for you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Damn, just turned on the news and seen that men who never got pussy in school
Are makin' laws about what women can do
I gotta protect ya, I'm a made man, tied in, all the way, baby
So I gotta respect ya
Niggas put hands on you in the past, insecure because your body is precious
Four words when I think about them is crusty, musty, dusty, rusty
Eight words when I think about us is fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
Disrespect ya and I'll smack 'em
The texts that you send in captions
The videos we got ever leak, we goin' viral or goin' platinum
Don't worry 'bout your friend's story when I had her alone
She gon' try and put some extras on it, take you out of your zone
You know how it goes when they can't get a reservation up in Carbone
They gon' tell you it's a chill night, tell you how they'd rather stay home, yeah
Jealous-ass hoes, yeah
And I know what I said 'bout bein' in Vogue
But just like that R&B group from the '90s
Girl, one call, I'll get you in Vogue
One call, you in runway shows
One call, I'm sittin' front row
One wrong call from your ex nigga sayin' dumb shit'll get him sent home
One call and my niggas ten toes
Down to go wherever I say go
Even if we gotta travel 'cross the globe
Down to take you to the end of the road, for real
[Chorus: Drake]
The way you make me feel these days
Somethin' gettin' dropped for you, baby girl
Smoke a nigga top for you, baby girl
Burn somebody block for you
The way you make me feel these days
Comin' out my body for you, baby girl
Wipe him like he snotty for you, baby girl
Comin' out my body for you

[Intro: Aran]
La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la

[Verse 1: Aran, All]
불꺼진 romantic all my life
내 주위는 온통 lovely day
내 눈 속에 비친 arrow sign
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

[Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]
I'm feeling lonely (Lonely)
그만 힐끗대고 말해줘요 hold me (Hold me)
다시 crying in my room
숨기고 싶어 (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still I want it more, more, more

[Chorus: All]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb

[Verse 2: Aran, Aran & Keena]
또 꿈길을 걷는 every day
눈 뜨면 다시 또 flew away
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)
나 솔직히 지금이 편해
상상만큼 짜릿한 걸까?

[Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]
Now I'm so lonely (Lonely)
매일 꿈속에서 연습했죠 kiss me (Kiss me)
다시 crying in my room
포기할까봐 (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still I want it more, more, more

[Chorus: All]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb

[Verse 3: Keena, Saena, Both]
I'm so lonely, hold me tightly
짜릿한 걸 원해 who will really love me truly
내게 기다림은 없어 I can't wait
더는 믿지 않아 now I'm gonna make it mine
Love is a light, I'ma show my love is right
It's not a joke, so give it to me right now
No more chance to you
You know, hey, d-d-d-dumb boy

[Bridge: Aran, Sio]
꿈속에 매일 밤
Someone who will share this feeling
I'm a fool
A fool for love, a fool for love
[Chorus: All, Aran, Sio]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb
I gave a second chance to Cupid (Hopeless girl is seeking)
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid (Someone who will share this feeling)

I'm tryna hit the group chat and tell 'em it's a—
Come and rescue me
Take me out the club, take me out the trap
Take me off the market, take me off the map

Man, I'm tryna hit the— (Ayy, what)

[Verse 2]
Don't hit me up and ""WYD"" me baby, nah
Send a boy a P-I-C or ""See me, baby"", damn
Okay, now we talkin', yeah, okay, now we talkin', yeah
Okay, now we talkin', yeah, when we talk, you gotta listen
I don't wanna go missin'
I wanna be consistent, not a opposition side
Put you in a—
I won't put you in that fucked up position, I
[Chorus]
I need someone to be patient with me
Someone to get money with, not take it from me, look
They don't even need to be as famous as me
I don't think I'll meet 'em at the places I be
But deep down I think about you all day, mami
I know I'm a pitbull, but dale, mami
I just wanna take you on a holiday, mami
Say what's on your mind, I'm a call away, mami

[Post-Chorus]
Come and rescue me (Woah)
Take me out the club (What?), take me out the trap (I-I-I)
Take me off the market, take me off the map
I'm tryna hit the group chat and tell 'em it's a—
Come and rescue me

You swear that you're stayin' single, next thing you know
You meet a girl at a bar and next thing you know
You get her laughin', it's 2AM
You're tellin' your buddies, three months in
That she ain't movin' in, the next thing you know
There's a U-Haul trailer, the next thing you know
Your old apartment, is y'all's new place
There goes the carpet but the deer head stays

[Chorus]
Next thing you know
You're savin' money like never before, just to
Spend it all at a jewelry store
Gettin' down on one knee on hеr mama's porch
Just prayin' she don't say, ""No""
Next thing you know
Your best man givеs a half-drunk speech and you're
Sunburnt on a honeymoon beach and your
Left hand's gettin' used to that ring
And there the next two or three years go
Next thing you know

[Verse 2]
You weren't really tryin', next thing you know
There's a test on the counter, next thing you know
She's standin' there cryin', noddin' her head yes
You're half excited, half scared to death

[Chorus]
'Cause next thing you know
You're wearin' scrubs and a funny white hat and the
Doctor's sayin', how you doin' there dad and
Nobody's ever called you that
And you take that drive home slow
Next thing you know
It's first steps, first dates, first car
It's 11:01 wonderin' where they are
You're sayin' that USC's too far
It's amazing how fast seventeen years go
Next thing you know
Next thing you know

[Bridge]
Next thing you know
You get to know your wife again and you're
More in love than you've ever been
With a lot of years of remember when's and still some down the road

[Chorus]
'Cause next thing you know
You got a yard full of your kid's kids
And you take 'em to church, teach 'em to fish
And you, tell 'em stories every chance you get
About how fast this life down here can go

Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

[Verse 1: RAYE]
A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

[Chorus: RAYE]
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel

[Verse 2: RAYE & 070 Shake]
Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in (What?)

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways
[Chorus: RAYE & 070 Shake]
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel, mm (What?)

[Verse 3: 070 Shake & RAYE]
'Cause I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
Be at peace with the things you can't change (Last night)
I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah
Out of reach, out of touch
Too numb, I don't feel no way
Toast up, so what?
Street small, but it go both ways
So, you'll run, yeah
But you'll never escape
Sunset in the maze
(You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel)

[Chorus: RAYE]
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night, oh
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel
[Bridge: RAYE & 070 Shake]
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
How I did, how I did, how I did last night

[Outro: RAYE]
Mm, lipstick smudged like modern art
I don't know where the fuck I am or who's drivin' the fuckin' car
Speedin' down the highway, sippin'
Mixin' pills with the liquor cah fuck these feelings
I left everyone I love on read (Uh-huh)
Spilling secrets to the stranger in my bed (Uh-huh)
I remember nothing so there's nothing to regret (Uh-uh)
Other than this 4/4 kick drum poundin' in my head (Mm)",0,2023,"Rap

[Coro: Payo Solís]
Me queda 1%
Y lo usaré solo para decirte lo mucho que lo siento
Que si me ven con otra en una disco solo es perdiendo el tiempo
Baby, ¿pa' qué te miento?
Eso de que me vieron feliz, no, no es cierto

[Verso 1: Payo Solís]
Ya nada me hace reír
Solo cuando veo las fotos y los videos que tengo de ti
Salí con otra para olvidarte y tenía el perfume que te gusta a ti
Prendo para irme a dormir
Porque duermo mejor si sueño que estás aquí
Si supieras que te escribí
No he mandado los mensajes, siguen todos ahí
Wow, qué mucho me ha costa'o
Quizás te hice un favor cuando me fui de tu lado
Borracho viendo tus fotos, me duele ver que tú sí has mejorado
No tienes días grises, ya no te duelen las cicatrices
Y yo pensando si decirte que

[Coro: Payo Solís & Bad Bunny]
Me queda 1%
Y lo usaré solo para decirte lo mucho que lo siento
Que si me ven con otra en una disco solo es perdiendo el tiempo
Baby, ¿pa' qué te miento?
Eso de que me vieron feliz, no, no es cierto (Ey)

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny]
Hace tiempo no pensaba en ti
Borracho a tu Insta me metí
Baby, ya yo sé que a ti te va bien
Que de mí tú no quieres saber, ey, ey
Viviendo en un infierno que yo mismo incendié
Jugando contigo como si fuese el die'
Siento que ya no estoy en tu corazón, ahora estoy en tus pie'
Rogándote, en el tequila ahogándome
Los muchacho' están invitándome a salir
La paso bien, pero siempre termino extrañándote
En el tequila ahogándome, ey
Las morritas texteándome, ey
Que dónde es la peda hoy, pero

[Coro: Bad Bunny]
Me queda 1%
Y lo usaré solo para decirte lo mucho que lo siento
Que si me ven con otra en una disco solo es perdiendo el tiempo
Baby, ¿pa' qué te miento?
Eso de que me vieron feliz no es cierto, ey

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Yeah, bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don’t care, I paint the town red
Bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red

[Post-Chorus: Doja Cat]
Mm, she the devil
She a bad lil’ bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle
Mm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Doja Cat]
Said my happiness is all of your misery
I put good dick all in my kidneys
This Margiel' don't come with no jealousy
My illness don't come with no remedy
I am so much fun without Hennessy
They just want my love and my energy
You can't talk no shit without penalties
Bitch, I’m in yo’ shit if you send for me
I'm going to glow up one more time
Trust me, I have magical foresight
You gon’ see me sleepin' in courtside
You gon' see me eatin' ten more times
Ugh, you can’t take that bitch nowhere
Ugh, I look better with no hair
Ugh, ain't no sign I can't smoke here
Ugh, gimme the chance and I'll go there (Yeah)

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Yeah, bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red
Bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red
[Post-Chorus: Doja Cat]
Mm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle
Mm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Doja Cat]
Said pop make money, now you try, bitch
You could use a revamp with a new vibe, sis
I don't need a big feature or a new sidekick
I don't need a new fan 'cause my boo like it
I don't need to wear a wig to make you like it
I'm a two-time bitch, you ain't knew I'd win?
Throw a shot like you tryna have a food fight then
All my opps waitin' for me to be you, I bet
Said I got drive, I don't need a car
Money really all that we fiendin' for
I'm doin' things they ain't seen before
Fans ain't dumb, but extremists are
I'm a demon lord
Fall off what? I ain't seen the horse
Called your bluff, better cite the source
Fame ain't somethin' that I need no more
[Chorus: Doja Cat]
'Cause, bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red
Bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red

[Post-Chorus: Doja Cat]
Mm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle
Mm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle

I could have my Gucci on
I could wear my Louis Vuitton
But even with nothin' on
Bet I made you look (I made you look)

I'll make you double take soon as I walk away
Call up your chiropractor just in case your neck break
Ooh, tell me what you, what you, what you gon' do, ooh
'Cause I'm 'bout to make a scene, double up that sunscreen
I'm 'bout to turn the heat up, gonna make your glasses steam
Ooh, tell me what you, what you, what you gon' do, ooh

English,54,Wait In The Truck,feat,HARDY Featuring Lainey Wilson,Wait In The Truck by HARDY Featuring Lainey Wilson,"[Verse 1: HARDY]
I got turned around in some little town
I'd never been to before
Workin' my way through a middle of June
Midnight thunderstorm
There was somethin' in the headlights
That stopped me on a dime
Well, she was scared to death
So I said, ""Climb in,"" and in she climbed
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2: HARDY]
Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe
With a tear in her blood-stained shirt
She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to
I knew what had happenеd to her
I didn't load her down with questions
That girl had been through еnough
I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes
And asked her where he was

[Chorus: Lainey Wilson, HARDY & Lainey Wilson]
I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under his seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again when he said to me
""Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck""

[Verse 3: HARDY]
Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came
So I kicked in his double-wide door
I let the hammer drop before he got
To that 12 he was reachin' for
I didn't try to hide my pistol
I didn't even try to run
I just sat on the porch, smokin' one of his cigarettes
And waited for the cops to come

[Chorus: Lainey Wilson, HARDY & Lainey Wilson]
I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under his seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again when he said to me
""Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck""

[Post-Chorus: HARDY, Lainey Wilson, Both]
Whoa (Oh)
Have mercy on me, Lord
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me, Lord (Oh)
[Bridge: HARDY]
It's been sixty months and she still comes
To see me from time to time
It was worth the price to see a brighter side
Of the girl I picked up that night
And I might be here forever
It ain't paradise, that's true
But it's a whole hell of a lot better
Than the place I sent him to
Yeah

[Outro: HARDY & Lainey Wilson, Choir]
(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me)
""Wait in the truck, just wait in the truck""

(Lord, have mercy)
(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me)
(Have mercy on me, Lord, have mercy on me)
(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me)
(Have mercy on me, Lord, have mercy on me)

English,55,All I Want For Christmas Is You,person,Mariah Carey,All I Want For Christmas Is You by Mariah Carey,"[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus]
I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you

[Outro]
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (Ah, oh, ah, oh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I really want, baby, ooh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I want, all I really want is you)",0,2023,"R&B

English,56,Everything I Love,person,Morgan Wallen,Everything I Love by Morgan Wallen,"[Verse 1]
I wish I woulda met you anywhere but where I did
Some old high-rise town that I won't ever go again
I wish we woulda rolled around in some old cab and chased them city lights
And hit bars I don't like

[Pre-Chorus]
We were listenin' to ""one more silver dollar""
Hangin' out my Silverado down a road I love to ride

[Chorus]
Wish I woulda known that by now you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us in a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love

[Verse 2]
I don't care how much they're bitin', I won't even crank the boat
Soon as that bobber hits thе water, girl, your memory starts to float
Baby, why'd l evеr take the bait and take you places that I love to go?
Hell, I'll never know

[Pre-Chorus]
I even took you to my hometown to meet my mama
Now I'm gonna see you every time I see that welcome sign

[Chorus]
Wish I woulda known that by now you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us in a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna hear ""one more silver dollar""
I can't take my Silverado down them roads we used to ride

[Chorus]
Wish I woulda known that by now you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us in a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
I can't go nowhere near the whiskey 'cause you used to drink it with me
In the bed of my truck and now I can't get drunk
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love",0,2023,"Country

Oxytocin makin' it all okay
When I come back down, it doesn't feel the same
Now, I'm sittin' 'round waitin' for the world to end all day
'Cause I couldn't leave you if I tried

[Pre-Chorus]
You break me, then I break my rules
Last time was the last time too
It's fucked up, I know, but I'm still

Outside of the party, smokin' in the car with you
Seven-nation army fightin' at the bar with you
Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do
'Cause I can't let go, it's chemical
No, I can't let go, it's chemical

You turn around and fuck out all my brains (Woo)
I ain't tryna fight fate, it's too late to save face
I can't get away, maybe there's no mistakes (Maybe there's no mistakes)

And I can't help it, it's the way I'm wired
Boy, you get too close
Boy, you need to know

[Chorus]
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that old highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leavin'
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beatin'
A little bit of love is all that it's needin'
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck

[Verse 2]
There ain't no brakin' when I throw it in drive
Don't always keep it in-between the lines
If you're a ready for a ridе, pedal-down state of mind
Boy, I tell you what, you bеtter buckle up

[Chorus]
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that old highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leavin'
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beatin'
A little bit of love is all that it's needin'
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck

[Bridge]
Go on and see if you can knock off the dust, yeah
Shine it up, rev it up, and let it run, yeah
It gets a high ridin' off into the sun, yeah

[Chorus]
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that old highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leavin'
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beatin'
A little bit of love is all that it's needin'
But it's good as it is tough

Some things in life are meant to fly
And others, they were born to run
You can't tie them up and leave 'em
Like the changing of the seasons
Good things, they come and then they go

[Chorus]
Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field home run ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone

[Verse 2]
I can say it wasn't meant to be
But maybe meant to be is misunderstood
I can't hold on to letting go
Change the way the river flows
Lovin' her's like roping in the wind

[Chorus]
Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field homerun ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone

[Bridge]
She ain't got one bit of stick around
There's no sense in tryin' to slow her down

[Chorus]
Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky

Rockin' around the Christmas tree

Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly""

Telling myself I won't go there
Oh, but I know that I won't care
Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt
This lust is a burden that we both share
Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer
Souls tied, intertwined by pride and guilt

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh) There's darkness in the distance
From the way that I've been livin'
(Ooh) But I know I can't resist it

[Chorus]
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from thе daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hatе it at the same time

[Verse 2]
Tellin' myself it's the last time
Can you spare any mercy that you might find
If I'm down on my knees again?
Deep down, way down, Lord, I try
Try to follow your light, but it's nighttime
Please don't leave me in the end

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh) There's darkness in the distance
I'm beggin' for forgiveness
(Ooh) But I know I might resist it, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight

I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else

[Pre-Chorus]
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alonе

[Chorus]
Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my

[Post-Chorus]
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
So I'll keep dancin' with my

[Verse 2]
Delusion is here again
And I think you'll come home soon
A word brings me right back in
Then it's only me that's in this room
I guess I could just pretend
The colours are more than blue
But I lost more than my friend
I can't help but missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I pictured this month a little bit different, no one is ever ready
And when it unfolds, you get in a hole, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Everything changes, nothing's the same, except the truth is now you're gone
And life just goes on

[Chorus]
So I'm dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Oh, I keep dancin' with my

They're shutting the bar, they're cleanin' the floor
And everyone is already home
But I'm on my own

Still dancin' with my eyes closed

And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombre' no compito
Que deje de estar tirando, que al meno' yo te tenía bonito

[Verso 1: Shakira]
Verte con la nueva me dolió (Dolió)
Pero ya estoy puesta pa' lo mío
Lo que vivimos se me olvidó
Y eso e' lo que te tiene ofendido
Que hasta la vida me mejoró
Por acá ya no eres bienvenido
Vi lo que tu novia me tiró
Eso no da ni rabia, yo me río, yo me río

[Verso 2: KAROL G & Shakira]
No tengo tiempo pa' lo que no aporte, ya cambié mi norte
Haciendo dinero como deporte
Llenando la cuenta, los show', el parking y el pasaporte (Ey)
'Toy más dura dicen lo' reporte' (Sí)
Ahora tú quiere' volver, se te nota, mmm, sí
'Pérame ahí, que yo soy idiota (Ah)
Se te olvidó que estoy en otra
Y que te quedó grande La Bichota

[Coro: Shakira & KAROL G]
Bebé, ¿qué fue? (Fue), ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (Ah)
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? (Ey) Si sabes que yo errores no repito
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito
Que deje de estar tirando, que al meno' yo te tenía bonito (Shakira, Shakira)

[Verso 3: Shakira & KAROL G]
Tú te fuiste y yo me puse triple M
Más buena, más dura, más level
Volver contigo never (No), tú eras la mala suerte
Porque ahora la' bendicione' me llueven
Y quiere' volver, ya lo suponía
Dándole like a la foto mía
Tú buscando por fuera la comida
Yo diciendo que era monotonía
Y ahora quieres volver, ya lo suponía
Dándole like a la foto mía (A la mía)
Te ves feliz con tu nueva vida
Pero si ella supiera que me busca' todavía

[Coro: KAROL G & Shakira]
Bebé, ¿qué fue? (Fue), ¿no pues que muy tragadito? (Ah)
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? (Ey) Si sabes que yo errores no repito (Ey)
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito (Mueve el culito)
Que no tiene buena mano, y al menos yo te tenía bonito
[Outro: KAROL G & Shakira]
Mi amor, es que usted se alejó mucho
Y yo de lejos no veo, bebé
TQM, pero TQG, jajaja

Sucker punch somebody on a sidewalk
Carjack an old lady at a red light
Pull a gun on the owner of a liquor store
Ya think it's cool, well, act a fool if ya like
Cuss out a cop, spit in his face
Stomp on the flag and light it up
Yeah, ya think you're tough

[Chorus]
Well, try that in a small town
See how far ya make it down the road
'Round here, we take care of our own
You cross that line, it won't take long
For you to find out, I recommend you don't
Try that in a small town

[Verse 2]
Got a gun that my granddad gave me
They say one day they're gonna round up
Well, that shit might fly in the city, good luck

[Chorus]
Try that in a small town
See how far ya make it down the road
'Round here, we take care of our own
You cross that line, it won't take long
For you to find out, I recommend you don't
Try that in a small town

[Bridge]
Full of good ol' boys, raised up right
If you're looking for a fight
Try that in a small town
Try that in a small town

[Chorus]
Try that in a small town
(See how far ya make it down the road)
'Round here, we take care of our own
You cross that line, it won't take long

Mama, I'm callin', I've got some news
Don't you tell Daddy, he'll blow a fuse
Don't worry, I'm doin' okay
I know you raised me to know right from wrong
It ain't what you think and I'm still writin' songs
Just never thought I'd see the day
I've never felt this way

[Chorus]
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

[Verse 2]
Took me to Knoxville last Saturday
And I wore the hat on his dash to the game
It sure wasn't Athens, but I
Fell for him under those Neyland lights

[Chorus]
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

[Bridge]
Mama, forgive me, I like him a lot
Hell, I'm learnin' the words to ""Old Rocky Top""
He's got a smile that makes me forget
I've always looked better in red

[Chorus]
But I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
And I still want the Dawgs to win
But I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

In the hood, I'm like Princess Diana (Grrah)
I'm thick 'cause I be eatin' oats (Huh)
Bitches not takin' shit from me but notes (Notes)
Wanna be me, so she do my emotes
And my name in her mouth so I bet she gon' choke (Bitch)
To her man, I'm the girl of his dreams

And I just fell in love with a gangsta (Grrah)
So I hold him down like an anchor (Grrah)

[Coro]
Baby, dime la verdad
Si te olvidaste de mí
Yo sé que fue una noche na' má'
Que no se vuelve a repetir
Tal ve' en ti quise encontrar
Lo que en otra perdí
Tu orgullo no me quiere hablar
Entonce' vamo' a competir, a ver, ey

[Verso 1]
No me gusta perder (Ey), dime qué vamo' a hacer
Me paso mirando el cel (Ah), wow, no puede ser (No, no)
Aunque me tarde un poco, juro que vo'a responder
Quisiera volverte a ver
Quisiera volverte a ver encima de mí brincando, uh, uh, uh
Lo rica que te ves chingando, uh, uh, uh (Ey, ey)
No sé qué estamo' esperando (Dime)
El orgullo nos está ganando, ey

[Coro]
Baby, dime la verdad
Si te olvidaste de mí
Yo sé que fue una noche na' má'
Que no se vuelve a repetir
Tal ve' en ti quise encontrar, ey
Lo que en otra perdí
Tu orgullo no me quiere hablar
Entonce' vamo' a competir, a ver, ey
[Verso 2]
Uh, desde que nos vimo' pienso en cómo nos comimo', ey
Después dividimo', cada cual por su camino
En la alfombra aún están las mancha' de vino
¿Dónde está ese totito? Que lleva tiempo perdido
Si te digo que me gusta', que estás buena, no lo tome' por cumplido
Es que yo soy un bellaco, es que yo soy un atrevido, ey
Y hace tiempo que quiero chingar contigo
Mami, te vo'a dar hasta que te duela la popola como a Glou (Glou)
Me gusta tu flow (Flow)
Tranquilita tú siempre te roba' el show (Ey)
Una perversa, le vo'a dar dembow (Mami)
Si se pone en cuatro, I go where she goes (Ey, ey, ey)
So, mami, dime a ver (Ey, ey)
I wanna feel that pussy again (Ey, ey)
Tú tiene' piquete y yo también (Yo también)
Por poco pierdo y te envío un DM, ey

[Coro]
Pa' decirte la verdad
Que no me he olvida'o de ti
Yo sé que fue una noche na' má'
Que no se vuelve a repetir
Tal vez en ti quise encontrar
Lo que en otra perdí
Tu orgullo no me quiere hablar
Entonce' vamo' a competir, a ver, ey

Defiendo lo que me pide el corazón

Beach towel rests on the dryin' line
Do I remind you of your daddy in his '88 Ford?
Labrador hangin' out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes
Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry
Do you remember that beat-down basement couch?
I'd sing you my love songs and you'd tell me about
How your mama ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything

[Chorus: Zach Bryan]
A cold shoulder at closing time
You were bеggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strangе words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you

[Verse 2: Kacey Musgraves]
You're drinkin' everything to ease your mind
But when the hell are you gonna ease mine?
You're like concrete feet in the summer heat
It burns like hell when two souls meet
No, you'll never be the man that you always swore
But I'll remember you singin' in that '88 Ford

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves, Zach Bryan & Kacey Musgraves, Zach Bryan]
A cold shoulder at closing time
You were beggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strange words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you
Cold shoulder at closing time
You were beggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strange words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you

[Outro: Zach Bryan]

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Ooh, girl, I like you, I do
I wanna be your friend, go shoppin' in a Benz
I like you, I do
I’ll hit you when I land, can you fit me in your plans?
I like you, I do
We went to bed in France, then we woke up in Japan
I like you, I do (I do), mm

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Oh, girl, I know you only like it fancy (Fancy)
So I pull up in that Maybach Candy
Yeah, your boyfriend'll never understand me (Understand)
'Cause I’m 'bout to pull his girl like a hammy, hammy (Wow)
Let's take a lil' dip, lil' lady
Hit PCH, 180
Hey, I been thinkin' lately
That I need someone to save me
Now that I'm famous, I got hoes all around me
But I need a good girl, I need someone to ground me
So, please be truе, don't fuck around with me
I need someone to sharе this heart with me
Fill you up, then run it back again (Run it back again)

Let me drop bands, put a jewel in ya teeth
He love the way I drip, turn that pool to the beach
And I coulda copped a Birkin but I cop Celine
Why we got the same taste for the finer things?
Brand new nigga with the same old team
Now he got me on a leash ’cause he said no strings
You know I'm cool with that
Stole the pussy, you ain't get sued for that (Get sued, sued)
Wonder what a nigga might do for that (Do, might do)
I could be your Chaka, where Rufus at? (Where?)
80 in the Benz when that roof go back, ayy

I just got a feelin' that we might be friends for a long, long time

Took a long vacation
No make-up, just JAY-Z
You were balls-deep, now we beefin'
Had me butt-naked at the MGM
So wasted, screamin', ""Fuck that""
Blurry now, but I meant it then
Hurry now, baby, stick it in
'Fore the memories get to kickin' in

It's too late, I don't wanna lose

What's left of you

I don't wanna see you with anyone but me?
Nobody gets me like you
How am I supposed to let you go?
Only like myself when I'm with you

Took me out to the ballet
You proposеd, I went on the road
You was feelin' empty so you lеft me
Now I'm stuck dealin' with a deadbeat
If I'm real, I deserve less
If I was you, I wouldn't take me back
I pretend when I'm with a man it's you

And I know that it's too late, I don't wanna lose

I've been sellin' my soul, workin' all day
Overtime hours for bullshit pay
So I can sit out here and waste my life away
Drag back home and drown my troubles away

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a damn shame what the world's gotten to
For people like me and people like you
Wish I could just wake up and it not be true
But it is, oh, it is

[Chorus]
Livin' in the new world
With an old soul
These rich men north of Richmond
Lord knows they all just wanna have total control
Wanna know what you think, wanna know what you do
And they don't think you know, but I know that you do
'Cause your dollar ain't shit and it's taxed to no end
'Cause of rich men north of Richmond

[Verse 2]
I wish politicians would look out for miners
And not just minors on an island somewhere
Lord, we got folks in the street, ain't got nothin' to eat
And the obese milkin' welfare
Well, God, if you're five-foot-three and you're three-hundred pounds
Taxes ought not to pay for your bags of Fudge Rounds
Young men are puttin' themselves six feet in the ground
'Cause all this damn country does is keep on kickin' them down

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord, it's a damn shame what the world's gotten to
For people like me and people like you
Wish I could just wake up and it not be true
But it is, oh, it is

[Chorus]
Livin' in the new world
With an old soul
These rich men north of Richmond
Lord knows they all just wanna have total control
Wanna know what you think, wanna know what you do
And they don't think you know, but I know that you do
'Cause your dollar ain't shit and it's taxed to no end

They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive

English,80,Dial Drunk,feat,Noah Kahan With Post Malone,Dial Drunk by Noah Kahan With Post Malone,"[Verse 1: Noah Kahan]
I'm rememberin' I promised to forget you now
But it's rainin' and I'm callin' drunk
And my medicine is drownin' your perspective out
So I ain't takin' any fault
Am I honest still? Am I half the man I used to be?
I doubt it, forget about it, whatever
And the dial tone is all I have

[Chorus: Noah Kahan]
I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio
I don't like that when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emеrgency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Evеn the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
I'll die

[Verse 2: Post Malone, Noah Kahan & Post Malone]
Drinks pourin', couldn't stop it
Turn another slow dance into a mosh pit
Tuck my head, then I heard the lock and
Told him that my first car was a Crown Vic
Talkin' 'bout last time I was in the back of a cop car
I fell in love
And my face on the cold window
Try to sober back up and loosen my cuffs
And it's all the same anyway

[Chorus: Noah Kahan & Post Malone, Post Malone]
Mm, I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio
I don't like that when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Even the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you

[Post-Chorus: Noah Kahan]
Well, I'd die for you

[Bridge: Noah Kahan, Noah Kahan & Post Malone]
I beg you, sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll praise the flag
Let's wait, I swear she'll call me back
""Son, are you a danger to yourself?""
Fuck that, sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll kiss the badge
Let's wait, I swear she'll call me back
""Son, why do you do this to yourself?""
[Chorus: Noah Kahan & Post Malone, Post Malone, Noah Kahan]
And I said I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown, ah
In the name of someone I no longer know (I no longer know)
For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio, ah
I don't like that when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Even the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up

I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?

[Verse 2]
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just somethin' you paid for
What was I made for?

[Chorus]
'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might

[Post-Chorus]
Mm, mm, ah
Mm, mm, mm

[Verse 3]
When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?

[Chorus]
'Cause I, 'cause I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might

[Outro]
Think I forgot how to be happy
Somethin' I'm not, but somethin' I can be
Somethin' I wait for
Somethin' I'm made for

English,83,Wait For U,feat,Future Featuring Drake & Tems,Wait For U by Future Featuring Drake & Tems,"[Intro: Future & Tems]
I will wait for you, for you
Early in the mornin', late at night (I will wait for you)
It don't even matter what time it is (I will wait for you)
Presidential Rollie, already on the way (Higher, sayin' higher-er-er-er)
Whenever I find time, it's okay (Ayy)
(ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)

[Verse 1: Future]
You pray for my demons, girl, I got you
Every time I sip on codeine, I get vulnerable
I'm knowin' the sounds of the storm when it come
She understand I can't take her everywhere a nigga goin'
I been in the field likе the children of the corn

[Chorus: Future & Tems]
I can hеar your tears when they drop over the phone
Get mad at yourself 'cause you can't leave me alone
Gossip, bein' messy, that ain't what we doin' (World was endin')
Travel around the world (Would you cry or would you try to get me?)
Over the phone, droppin' tears (Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah)
I get more vulnerable when I do pills (Tell me now, I need you to be clear, yeah)
When you drunk, you tell me exactly how you feel (I will wait for you, for you)
When I'm loaded, I keep it real (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)
Need to tell a real one exactly what it is (I will wait, will wait, for you, for you)
Don't say it 'cause you know that's what I wanna hear (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)

[Verse 2: Drake & Tems]
Yeah, I been trappin' 'round the world
I sit on my balcony and wonder how you feelin'
I got a career that takes my time away from women
I cannot convince you that I love you for a livin' (Will wait for you, for you)
I be on your line, feeling's flowin' like a river
You be textin' back, you at Kiki on the river (I will wait for you)
Message say delivered, but I know that you don't get it (I will wait for you)
Why you introduce us if you knew that you was with him? (I will wait for you, for you, for you)
Made me shake his hand when y'all been fuckin' for a minute (I will wait for you, for you)
Walk me off the plank because you know that I'm a swimmer (I will wait for you)
Supposed to be your dog, but you done put me in a kennel
Girl, put a muzzle on it, all that barkin' over dinner
I was fuckin' with you when you had the tiny Presidential
You got better when you met me and that ain't coincidental
Tried to bring the best out you, guess I'm not that influential
Guess I'm not the one that's meant for you

[Chorus: Drake, Tems & Future]
I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone
Get mad at myself 'cause I can't leave you alone
Gossip in messages, that ain't what we doin', yeah (World was endin')
Trappin' around the world (Would you cry or would you try to get me?)
Over the phone, droppin' tears (Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah)
I get more vulnerable when I do pills (Tell me now, I need you to be clear, yeah)

(Happy Christmas)
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh-woah
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby

[Verse 2]
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave me away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
[Verse 3]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man undercover, but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special

[Bridge]
Special
Someone
Someone
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Who give me something in return
(I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone)
Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
I thought you were here to stay
How could you love me for a day?
I thought you were someone special
I gave you my heart
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
You gave it away
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone

English,85,Handle On You,person,Parker McCollum,Handle On You by Parker McCollum,"[Verse 1]
I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone
Drop a needle on a vinyl and cry to an old Haggard song
Sittin' at the table, baby, breakin' the seal
Gonna see how much of this pain I can kill
I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone

[Chorus]
Tennessee and Kentucky
'Cause you ain't here to love me
I drink now that there's nothing to lose
I've been fightin' with your memory
I hate the way it hits me
I wake up every day black and blue
After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do
Yeah, I finally got a handle, finally got a handle on you

[Verse 2]
I tell myself that I should quit, but I don't listen to drunks
I keep on sippin' 'til ""I miss you"" don't roll off my tongue
Since you poured our love down the sink
I think I'll just stay here and drink
I tell myself that I should quit, but I don't listen to drunks

[Chorus]

'Cause you ain't here to love me
I drink now that there's nothing to lose

Spanish,86,Por Las Noches,person,Peso Pluma,Por Las Noches by Peso Pluma,"[Letra de ""Por Las Noches""]

Cuando por las noches recordaba todo
El olor de aquel perfume sobre todo
Las sábanas blancas donde te escondías dentro

Eres intocable como joya de oro
Esas piernas largas comerme yo solo
Y tus ojos grandes, me perdí en un laberinto

Y pensar
Que tú ya no vas a estar
Pasará
Solito me dejará
Intentar
Solo un beso y tú te vas
De mi vida, ah, ah
Como tú no hay nadie más
No hay nadie más

Ah
¿Y qué?

Si te sientes sola no me llames porfa
Me pongo sensible, me imagino tu sombra
Clase Azul es el tequila e interior la ropa
Rico Prat champaña, el polvo es color rosa
Me contactó un ángel, eres tú mi hermosa
La que me alegra los días y sigo tomando

Y pensar
Que tú ya no vas a estar
Pasará
Solito me dejarás
Intentar
Solo un beso y tú te vas
De mi vida, ah, ah
Como tú no hay nadie más
No hay nadie más",0,2023,"Pop

If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I'd put my money down and I'd sign my name
On that little corner lot where it don't ever rain
And we'd stay good as new like a fresh coat of paint
You'd be mine in the shine of a front porch light
Yeah, I might as well live there, baby
That's where I spend most of my time

[Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled up mornings lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder
We'd never let go and we'd never be over

[Verse 2]
If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I wouldn't have to wonder if you miss me the same
I'd be loving you as usual, telling you you're beautiful
Oh, I'd be happily delusional

[Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled up mornings lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder
We'd never let go and we'd never be over

[Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled up mornings lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder

If I could buy a house on Memory Lane

English,89,Bury Me In Georgia,person,Kane Brown,Bury Me In Georgia by Kane Brown,"[Intro]
Bury me in Georgia
Mm-hmm
Mm-hmm

[Verse 1]
Ten miles out of Chattanooga
South of that state line
There's a no-name road off Highway 2
Just past the welcome sign
It's where I was born, it's where I was raised
Ain't sayin' I'm ready yet
But that's the place I wanna be after my last breath

[Chorus]
Bury me in Georgia
Let me rest in peace
Underneath the pines, yeah, yeah, yeah
Where my roots run deep (Where my roots run deep)
Whеn it's my day, put me in that clay
And remembеr what I told you
When I die, bury me in Georgia
Mm-hmm

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I don't care what color my suit is
Or what shoes y'all put on my feet
I don't care how many show up, yeah
Or who reads my eulogy
Just take me out to that graveyard
Sing a send me home song
Put ""Go Dawgs"" on my headstone (Headstone)
And pile that red dirt on

[Chorus]
Bury me in Georgia (Woo)
Let me rest in peace
Underneath the pines, yeah, yeah, yeah
Where my roots run deep (Where my roots run deep)
When it's my day, put me in that clay
And remember what I told you
When I die, bury me in Georgia
Georgia
Hell, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Check this out
For my final will and testament
Let this be my last request
Leave it all to my family
You already know what's next
Yeah, bury me in Georgia

[Chorus]
Bury me in Georgia
Let me rest in peace
Underneath the pines, yeah, yeah, yeah
Where my roots run deep (Where my roots run deep)
When it's my day, put me in that clay
And remember what I told you
When I die, bury me in Georgia
Mm-hmm
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah
That's funky right there (Mm-hmm, come on)

[Verso 1: Peso Pluma & Natanael Cano]
Me levanto, un baño y luego me pongo a forjar
Es veneno, da pa' arriba, de muy buena calidad
Los teléfonos no paran nunca de sonar
Si no es alguna plebita, es porque un cliente quiere más

[Coro: Peso Pluma & Natanael Cano]
Y bien forrados los paquetes van
No hay pendiente, no puedo fallar
Siempre estoy listo para cruzar
Polvo, ruedas y también cristal
Aquí el papelito viene y va
Las morritas bien locas se van
Disfrutamos, esté bien o mal
De esta vida no me vo'a quejar

[Interludio: Natanael Cano]
¡Eah!
Y bien jalados
Con la Doble P
Los corridos tumbados
Así nomas, viejo

[Verso 2: Natanael Cano & Peso Pluma]
Fino con las Balenciaga, corridos bien vergas sonaban
Las morritas muy bien bailaban, y yo ando Silver LV
Siento que ando volando ya, carnal
Y aquí nunca nos vamos a quejar
¿Para qué vamos a voltear pa'tras?
No hay pedo, yo le vo'a atorar

[Coro: Natanael Cano & Peso Pluma]
Bien forrados los paquetes van
No hay pendiente, no puedo fallar
Siempre estoy listo para cruzar
Polvo, ruedas y también cristal
Y bien forrados los paquetes van
No hay pendiente, no puedo fallar
Siempre estoy listo para cruzar
Polvo, ruedas y también cristal

English,91,What My World Spins Around,person,Jordan Davis,What My World Spins Around by Jordan Davis,"[Verse 1]
I love a first cast when the water's glass and the line starts to run
Or that first sip of a cold beer when the working week's done
I love the twilight in the morning 'fore the day wakes up
With the windows down on the first ride in a paid-up truck
And I love a slow down in a beach town with an ocean view
And I love a first fall Saturday trip down to Baton Rouge
And I love a six-string with the stars out and the campfire glow
But girl, that don't even come close

[Chorus]
To the way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearin'
That look in your eye, girl, when you catch me starin'
And I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it
I can't imagine me livin' without this
Back forty view on our piece of ground
Watching you watch the sun going down
That's what my world spins around

[Verse 2]
Well, I finally get it now, when they say you know, you know
And yeah, girl, you had me from that first hello
And the only thing better is Heaven above
But until I get there, I'll never get enough of

[Chorus]
The way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearin'
That look in your eye, girl, when you catch me starin', and
I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it
I can't imagine me livin' without this
Back forty view on our piece of ground
Watching you watch the sun going down
That's what my world spins around

[Post-Chorus]
What my world spins around
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
The way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
And I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearin'
And that look in your eye, girl, when you catch me starin', and
I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it

Man, ain't that some shit
Ain't that some, ain't that some, ain't that some shit
Yeah

[Verse 2]
My true North is due South with a blue Coors goin' down
Just like that settin' sun on my old Z-71
I know it's cliché to sing Chevrolets, cold beers and Fridays
But that's just the way it is out here

[Chorus]
Ain't that some back home, buddies in the field, mud on the wheels, yeah
Ain't that some thick smoke, Silverado, tearin' up a two-lane road
Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y, shit we been doin' since we was yea high
There's folks out there ain't T-R-Y-D this
Man, ain't that some shit
Ain't that some, ain't that some, ain't that some shit

English,93,Wild As Her,person,Corey Kent,Wild As Her by Corey Kent,"[Verse 1]
She never wanted to be white-picket fenced in
Her heart's like a feather in a Tulsa wind
Seaside breeze'll bring her to life
And all them other boys say she's a goodbye girl
She'll wreck your world
And leave before the mornin' sun
But here she is, free, lyin' next to me
'Cause I ain't tryna tame her love

[Chorus]
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild

[Verse 2]
Saw that highway unwind in her deep-brown eyes
She saw a long stretch of dirt road dreamin' in mine
She ain't livin' for a diamond ring
Just livin' like the rock 'n' roll song she sings out loud
We're burnin' it down
Blazin' up a trail of smoke
Wherever we are, wherever we go
Yeah, that's where she calls home

[Chorus]
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild
Yeah, yeah, man

[Bridge]
Yeah
I ain't tryna fix her, I just wanna kiss her
Fuel a little fire in her soul
No, we don't say ""forever,"" but when we're together
Swear that we ain't ever lettin' go, yeah, she knows

[Chorus]
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her

When it comes to hitchin' the boat up
Backin' down the ramp in my old truck
To find a bunch of logs
To catch a bunch of hogs
Yeah, I wrote the book
Yeah, I wrote the book

If you wanna learn to throw a curve right
To catch a clean up lookin' on a third strike
Talk a little smack while he's walkin' back
Yeah, I wrote the book

[Chorus]
But there's one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write

[Verse 3]
I met a good girl she had her life straight
She said she loved that I was good at everythin'
One day she left me in a cloud of dust
'Cause I never was too good at pickin' up

The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
The one that says don't cuss and don't fight

[Intro: Shakira]
(Pa' tipos como tú, uh-uh-uh-uh)
Oh-oh (Oh-oh)
(Pa' tipos como tú, uh-uh-uh-uh)

[Verso 1: Shakira]
Perdón, ya cogí otro avión
Aquí no vuelvo, no quiero otra decepción
Tanto que te las das de campeón
Y cuando te necesitaba diste tu peor versión
Sorry, baby, hace rato
Que yo debí botar ese gato
Una loba como yo no está pa' novato'

[Coro: Shakira]
Una loba como yo no está pa' tipos como tú, uh-uh-uh-uh
Pa' tipos como tú, uh-uh-uh-uh
A ti te quedé grande y por eso estás con una igualita que tú, uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verso 2: Shakira]
Esto es pa' que te mortifique', mastique' y trague', trague' y mastique'
Yo contigo ya no regreso, ni que me llores ni me supliquе'
Entendí que no es culpa mía quе te critiquen
Yo solo hago música, perdón que te salpique
Me dejaste de vecina a la suegra
Con la prensa en la puerta y la deuda en Hacienda
Te creíste que me heriste y me volviste más dura
Las mujeres ya no lloran, las mujeres facturan

[Pre-Coro: Shakira]
Tiene nombre de persona buena
Claramente no es como suena
Tiene nombre de persona buena
Claramente

[Coro: Shakira]
Es igualita que tú, uh-uh-uh-uh
Pa' tipos como tú, uh-uh-uh-uh
A ti te quedé grande y por eso estás con una igualita que tú, uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verso 3: Shakira]
Del amor al odio hay un paso
Por acá no vuelva', hazme caso
Cero rencor, bebé, yo te deseo que te vaya bien con mi supuesto reemplazo
No sé ni qué es lo que te pasó
'Tás tan raro que ni te distingo
Yo valgo por dos de 22
Cambiaste un Ferrari por un Twingo
Cambiaste un Rolex por un Casio
Vas acelera'o, dale despacio
Ah, mucho gimnasio
Pero trabaja el cerebro un poquito también
Fotos por donde me ven
Aquí me siento un rehén, por mí todo bien
Yo te desocupo mañana y si quieres traértela a ella, que venga también
[Pre-Coro: Shakira]
Tiene nombre de persona buena (Uh-uh-uh-uh)
Claramente no es como suena (Uh-uh-uh-uh)
Tiene nombre de persona buena (Uh-uh-uh-uh)

[Coro: Shakira]
Y una loba como yo no está pa' tipos como tú, uh-uh-uh-uh
Pa' tipos como tú, uh-uh-uh-uh
A ti te quedé grande y por eso estás con una igualita que tú, uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Outro: Shakira]
Uh-uh-uh-uh (Pa' tipos, pa'-pa'-pa' tipos como—)
Pa' tipos como tú, uh-uh-uh-uh (Pa' tipos, pa'-pa'-pa' tipos como—)
A ti te quedé grande y por eso estás con una igualita que tú, uh-uh-uh-uh

Teatime like I got a cup of this shit
Tee time like golf at a quarter to six
I love to fuck on a regular bitch
Famous hoes lame, but they stay on my dick
Heard your new joint, it's embarrassing, shit
You talk to the cops on some therapist shit
You act like you love this American shit
But, really, the truth is you scared of the 6
Yeah, you scared of the 6
Yeah, you scared of the 6
Your bodyguard put in some work on a fluke
Now you wanna go and inherit that shit
Don't talk to the boy 'bout comparisons, shit
Or come to the boy on some arrogant shit
The weapons we got are some terrorist shit
Like TV producers we, grr, we airing this shit
She askin' for bread for her parents and shit
I told her I don't got no cash and she said she could wait on a rack, on some Arabic shit
I pull out a million and stare at the shit
My dick just got hard 'cause a wire just hit
My schedule is out, come spin us, for real
Man, fuck all that spinnin' the narrative shit
I melt down the chains that I bought from yo' boss
Give a fuck about all of that heritage shit
Since V not around, the members done hung up the Louis, they not even wearing that shit
Don't come to the boy 'bout repairing some shit
Don't come to the boy about sparing some shit
You lucky that Vogue was suing 'cause I would've been with the Wassas in Paris and shit

Is you fuckin' crazy? Is you fuckin' crazy? (Ah)
And they scared of the seven (Seven)
After one-three then we turn up eleven (Yeah)
Keep this shit open like 7-Eleven (It's lit)
Me at the house, I got seven in heaven
They think I'm satanic, I keep me a reverend
Lil' shawty a therapist (yeah), poppin' her shit
She inching my way then she started confessing
I know what's at stake, I'm screamin', ""Free Jeffery""
Connect collect calls right off of the celly
Gave her the blues, not talkin' 'bout belly
Don't keep it sincere, I go Makaveli
I got the juice, now it's heavy (Juice)
Always on t-time, been ready (T, ah), yeah
Is you fucking crazy? Is you f— (Yeah, stoned, let's go)
Wrappin' the cheese, wrap around me 'cause I've got property (Wrap, cheese, wrap)
Chocolate AP and chocolate the Vs (Vs), got the Willy Wonka factory (Vs)
Burn a athlete like it's calories, find another flame hot as me, bitch

How many Texas boys done ran it up? A couple, maybe (Couple, maybe)
Swanging in the pickup truck, baby, fuck Mercedes (Fuck Mercedes)
I'll fuck a nigga bitch but she can't have the baby (Have the baby)
I'll shoot your ass in Walmart like I'm DaBaby (In Walmart)
The boy going Lionel Messi, I go Tom Brady (Woo)
Used to wear the bust down back in my old days (Woo)
Now I let the chains hang, you gotta tuck yours maybe (Tuck it, tuck it)
Niggas talkin' Scarface, I'm that in real life (Ooh)

Man, the club ain't been the same since we lost Mercedes (Straight up)
Man, the clique ain't been the same since they lost the greatest (Nah, nah, nah)

Them boys rollin' all brown like they whippin' gravy
Make a circus outside like it's Barnum's Bailey (It's lit)

Teatime like I got a cup of this
Tee time like golf at a quarter to six
I love to chill with a regular girl
Famous folks can be dull, but they stay on my radar
Heard your new track, it’s not impressive
You talk to the cops, that’s unnecessary
You act like you love this American scene
But, really, the truth is you’re scared of the 6
Yeah, you’re scared of the 6
Yeah, you’re scared of the 6
Your bodyguard did some work on a whim
Now you wanna go and inherit that stuff
Don't talk to me about comparisons
Or come to me with arrogance
The tools we use are impressive
Like TV producers, we’re showcasing it
She’s asking for support for her family
I told her I don’t have cash, but she can wait
I pull out a million and admire it
My interest just peaked because a wire just hit
My schedule is out, come spin us, for real
Man, forget all that spinning the narrative
I melt down the chains I bought from your boss
Don’t care about all that heritage
Since V’s not around, the team’s put away the Louis, they’re not even wearing that stuff
Don’t come to me about fixing things
Don’t come to me about being lenient

Are you out of your mind? Are you out of your mind?
And they’re cautious of the seven
After one-three, then we turn up eleven
Keep this place open like 7-Eleven
Me at the house, I’ve got seven in heaven
They think I’m unconventional, I keep me a guide
Little shorty’s a therapist, popping her talk
She’s coming my way then she started confessing
I know what’s at stake, I’m shouting, “Free Jeffery”
Connect collect calls right off of the celly
Gave her the blues, not talking 'bout the clothing
Don’t keep it sincere, I go with my own style

How many Texas folks done made it big? A couple, maybe
Swanging in the pickup truck, not just Mercedes
I’ll be with someone but they can't have a child
I’ll deal with issues like I’m DaBaby
The boy going Lionel Messi, I go Tom Brady
Used to wear the bust down back in my old days
Now I let the chains hang, you might tuck yours
Folks talking Scarface, I’m that in real life
Are you out of your mind or what? Are you out of your mind?
Man, the club ain’t been the same since we lost Mercedes
Man, the team ain't been the same since they lost the greatest
We’re out with the squad, so you need the
Them folks rolling all around like they’re cooking
Make a scene outside like it’s a big event
The vibe’s hanging on my side, it’s like it’s really there
She moves her dress to the side, she wants it real when faded

Big Latto (Bop)

[Verse 1: Latto]
Rip me out the plastic, I been actin' brand new
Bitches actin' like they runnin' shit, they really ran through
I'll spend that five hundred 'fore I ever trap you
They thought I was gon' fall off, I hate to bring you bad news
Threw so many racks, a bitch can't even see the floor
From Atlanta to L.A., the only time I'm back and forth
Cheap niggas make you pick, rich niggas get you both
Gave the Bentley to valet and let that nigga drive the boat
Shh, be quiet (Be quiet), lеt me pop off
Leave thе club sloppy drunk, come home and get my rocks off
Heard ""Bitch from Da Souf,"" he tryna see me knock his socks off
Told them bitches, ""Meet me at the top,"" think they got lost
Tuh, I'm on go like Grizz
She thought I would kiss her ass, she must ain't took her meds, tuh
Shit around my neck, it cost a arm and leg
Swear that nigga set for life, I let him get me preg'

[Chorus: Latto]
I done done it all (Tuh), feel like Shawty Lo (Tuh)
Laughin' to the bank (Tuh), but shit is not a joke (Tuh)
Say she got a problem (Tuh), imaginary smoke (Tuh)
Bitches said it's up (Tuh), then put it on the floor (Tuh)
I done done it all (Tuh), feel like Shawty Lo (Tuh)
Laughin' to the bank (Tuh), but shit is not a joke (Tuh)
Say she got a problem (Tuh), imaginary smoke (Tuh)
Bitches said it's up (Tuh), then put it on the floor (Tuh)

[Post-Chorus: Latto]
I don't know what y'all been told (Told)
Bet yo' mans know, if you don't, what's happenin'?

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Put a ribbon on me, I been actin' brand new
I ain't smokin' on no za, lil' bitch, I'm smokin' on you
Put your bestie in a pack and now I'm smokin' her too
I been ballin' so damn hard, could've went to LSU, huh
Got so many chains on, I can't even see my throat
These hoes don't do enough, that's why I always do the most
Broke niggas give the dick, rich niggas sponsor goals
Only thing a nigga get from me for free is free the bros
Let me pop it off
Point me to the biggest slut, baby girl, come top it off
She said she don't like me 'cause she love me, duh, knock it off
That bitch made ten pages just to sub me, but I block 'em all
All these hoes is mid
Got her lurkin' on my page before she feed her kids, huh
Shittin' on these bitches, dunkin' on they heads
Get these hoes some melatonin, put they ass to bed (Bitch)
Nigga, cry for what? Bitch, these are Denim Tears (Huh)
I'm sexy dancin' in the house, I feel like Britney Spears
So put it on the floor, just like they career
What they got on me? Bodies and a couple years
[Chorus: Latto]
I done done it all (Tuh), feel like Shawty Lo (Shawty Lo)
Laughin' to the bank (Tuh), but shit is not a joke (Not a joke)
Say she got a problem (Tuh), imaginary smoke (Brr)

[Verse 1: Latto]
Rip me out the plastic, I’ve been acting brand new
People act like they’re running things, but they’ve been through
I’ll spend that five hundred before I ever trap you
They thought I was gonna fall off, I hate to bring you bad news
Threw so many racks, a person can’t even see the floor
From Atlanta to L.A., the only time I’m back and forth
Budget folks make you choose, wealthy folks get you both
Gave the Bentley to valet and let that person drive the boat
Shh, be quiet, let me pop off
Leave the club, come home and relax
Heard ""Bitch from Da Souf,"" he’s trying to see me knock his socks off
Told them, ""Meet me at the top,"" think they got lost
Tuh, I’m on go like Grizz
She thought I would kiss her, she must've missed her meds
Shit around my neck, it cost an arm and a leg
Swear that person set for life, I let him get me pregnant

Put a ribbon on me, I’ve been acting brand new
I’m not indulging in anything, little person, I’m focused on you
Put your friend in a pack and now I’m done with her too
I’ve been ballin’ so hard, could’ve gone to LSU, huh
Got so many chains on, I can’t even see my throat
These folks don’t do enough, that’s why I always do the most
Financially strained folks give a lot, wealthy folks sponsor goals
Only thing a person gets from me for free is free the bros
Let me pop it off
Point me to the biggest, come on, let’s top it off
She said she doesn’t like me 'cause she loves me, so knock it off
That person made ten pages just to sub me, but I block 'em all

Got her lurking on my page before she tends to her kids, huh
Showing off these skills, outdoing them
Get these folks some rest, put them to bed
Cry for what? These are Denim Tears (Huh)

Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone, I'll tell them my religion's you
When Punktious comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands
Hands above my head, hands together
Forgive him before he's dead because

English,100,Watermelon Moonshine,person,Lainey Wilson,Watermelon Moonshine by Lainey Wilson,"[Verse 1]
It was right after senior year
Just before the summer disappeared
We went a-ridin' them old farm ruts
Hangin' out on the gate of his truck
We threw a blanket 'neath the sunset
Bein' brave as eighteen gets
We gave each other more than our hearts
With the help of a mason jar

[Chorus]
Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was minе
Too young to know what love was
But we werе learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
Watermelon moonshine

[Verse 2]
I don't remember where we got it from
I just remember feelin' all grown up
Takin' pulls like it ain't no thing
Never told him it was my first drink
But I told him that he was the one
You're so sure when you're that young
You think you got it all figured out
And now I laugh when I think about

[Chorus]
Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was mine
Too young to know what love was
But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
Watermelon moonshine

[Bridge]
I thought that high would last forever
But that ain't what it does
Maybe we were drunk in love
Or maybe we were just

[Chorus]
Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was mine
Too young to know what love was
But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like

Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

English,2,As It Was,person,Harry Styles,As It Was by Harry Styles,"[Intro]
Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you

[Verse 1]
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
Answer the phone
""Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?""
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

[Bridge]
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can’t find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (Oh)

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
I realize the time that I wasted here
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
Oh, I’ll be fucked up if you can't be right here

And you know that I know that I can't live without you
So, baby, stay

English,4,Easy On Me,person,Adele,Easy On Me by Adele,"[Verse 1]
There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in

[Chorus]
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

[Verse 2]
There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up

[Chorus]
Go easy on mе, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel thе world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

[Bridge]
I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show

English,5,Shivers,person,Ed Sheeran,Shivers by Ed Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like

[Chorus]
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til thе sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, ""Ooh, I love it when you do it like that""
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

[Verse 2]
Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mmm, you got me feelin' like

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like

[Chorus]
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, ""Ooh, I love it when you do it like that""
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
[Bridge]
Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started
I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver-er-er
Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started
I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver
Yeah, you got me singin' like

[Chorus]
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back (Oh, no)
And we'll say, ""Ooh, I love it when you do it like that""
And when you're close up, give me the shivers

I can see the whole city from this balcony
Back in 2019, I was outside freely, but now they got it out for me
I don't care what frat that you was in, you can't alpha me, keep dreamin'
Pineapple juice, I give her sweet, sweet, sweet semen
I know what they like so I just keep cheesin'
Hard drive full of heat seekin'
Tryna come the same day as Jack? Rethink it
You don't need Givenchy, you need Jesus
Why do y'all sleep on me? I need reasons
Uh, I got plaques in thе mail, peak season
Shout out to my UPS workers makin' surе I receive 'em
You can do it too, believe it

They say, ""You a superstar now,"" damn, I guess I am
You might be the man, well, that's unless I am
Okay, I'll confess I am
Go ahead and get undressed, I am
Okay, cool, you on Sunset? (I am)
I'm 'bout to slide, okay, I'm outside, okay
This lifestyle don't got many downsides
'Cept for the lack of time I get 'round my
Family, makin' sure they never downsize
I got visions of my mom sayin', ""Wait, this house mine?""
Can't lie, I'm on Angus, Cloud 9
I got 'em on the bandwagon now, 'bout time
I ain't even got no downtime
Every time I speak, she say, ""Yeah, that sounds fine""

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

[Chorus]
That if I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (More than life)
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I need more time, but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

That if I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (Yeah)
And if you can't be next to me

I miss you more than life

Well, we could be superstars
We been rather wreckin' cars (Ayy bro, is that Jambo?)
What is at stakes for us?
Kickin' off power mirrors
Yeah, we could be superstars
But I'm pretty sure our time is up
And so we fell off the spinning tops
Don't know, maybe for trial (ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)
But way more error (Huh)

[Verse 1]
Say you my nigga, I'ma be your killer
Nobody gon' play with you when I'm with you
Go against any nigga, like, fuck this glitter
Skeet off third, I'm busy
I put it in for you, I spinned for you
Whatever you with, I'm with it
How you gon' cross a nigga that was rockin' with you? I got you lit in the city
I been multitaskin', rappin' and bein' a daddy to my lil' children
I been standin' on business, and spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin' until I'm dizzy
I do all the smackin', you ain't never stepped or helped with none of this killin'
You doin' lot of cappin', watch whеn I catch you, I'ma whack you in front the witness

[Chorus]
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could'vе been superstars
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, you better keep your distance
'Cause it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch

[Post-Chorus]
Trackhawk with the kit, snatch off on the bitch
When I slide, nightlight on the blick, bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside
Zoe done ran down, caught him pants down, nigga, you shitted
I knew the Perc' was fake, but I still ate it 'cause I'm a gremlin

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Kutthroat business, KTB, backdoor wide open
Wait 'til my sniper get loud, all you niggas gon' die, time rollin'
Bustin' on my opponent, no half-steppin', crushin' my opps totally
We was just broke with no motion
Sleepin' on sofas, creepin' in houses like roaches
I done went cages, to stages, to cages
Now free me, baby, can't keep me, baby
I beat them cases, they already hate me
They gon' want me dead when I'm off probation
Oh, y'all think lil' Yak retarded?
Y'all ain't seen nothin' yet, I promise
Niggas can't take me, niggas can't guard me
I be on a fuck nigga ass like Charmin
AK, twenty-inch carbon

[Chorus]
We could've been superstars
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, you better keep your distance
'Cause it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
[Post-Chorus]
Trackhawk with the kit, snatch off on the bitch
When I slide, nightlight on the blick, bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside
Zoe done ran down, caught him pants down, nigga, you shitted
I knew the Perc' was fake, but I still ate it 'cause I'm a gremlin

Yeah, we could be superstars (Super Gremlin)
But I'm pretty sure our time is up (Now your time is up)

Don't know, maybe for trial
But way more error
I ain't slimy, I'm grimy
Any way you put it, I'm SG with it, I'm Super Gremlin

I bet you always see me in your dreams

Well, we could be superstars
We’ve been trying, reaching far (Ayy bro, is that Jambo?)
What is at stakes for us?
Dreamin' big, chasing stars
Yeah, we could be superstars
But I'm pretty sure our time is up
And so we fell off the spinning tops
Don't know, maybe for trial (ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)
But with a lot more learning (Huh)

[Verse 1]
Say you my friend, I'ma be your guide
Nobody gon' doubt you when I'm by your side
We’ll face whatever comes, like stars that glitter
Stay focused, no quitter
I put in work for you, I stand with you
Whatever you need, I'm in it too
How you gon' turn on someone who was ridin' with you? I helped you shine in the city
I been multitaskin', workin' hard and bein' a father to my little children
I been stayin' committed, focused and movin' forward until I'm dizzy
I do all the effort, you ain’t ever stepped or helped with any of this progress
You talkin' a lot, but just wait, I’ll show you success in front of everyone

[Chorus]
Damn, my friend, you’re driftin'
We could've been superstars
Remember when we were dreamin' large
Now, it's not the same for you
You changed like a distant soul
Damn, my friend, you’re driftin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we were dreamin' large
Now, you better keep your focus
'Cause it's not the same for you
You changed like a distant soul

[Post-Chorus]
Movin' fast with the plan, focused on the goal
When I rise, light shines on the dream, bet I'm on my way when I'm outside
Success done come around, caught 'em off guard, you couldn’t believe it
I knew the risk was high, but I still took it 'cause I'm determined

[Verse 2]
Yeah, focused living, staying driven, doors wide open
Wait 'til we rise higher, all the challenges gon' fade, time moving
Workin' hard, no half-steppin', crushing my goals fully
We were just stuck with no motion
Sleepin' on couches, hustling with no direction
I done went from struggles to stages
Now I’m free, baby, can’t hold me, baby
I beat the odds, though they doubted me
They gon' be proud when they see what I’m creating
Oh, y’all thought I was done?
Y’all ain’t seen nothin' yet, I promise
Challenges can't stop me, doubts can’t block me
I be on a winning streak, movin' forward
Clear mind, focused heart, steady motion

[Chorus]
We could've been superstars
Remember when we were dreamin' large
Now, it's not the same for you
You changed like a distant soul
Damn, my friend, you’re driftin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we were dreamin' large
Now, you better keep your focus
'Cause it's not the same for you
You changed like a distant soul

Movin' fast with the plan, focused on the goal
When I rise, light shines on the dream, bet I'm on my way when I'm outside
Success done come around, caught 'em off guard, you couldn’t believe it

English,11,Wait For U,feat,Future Featuring Drake & Tems,Wait For U by Future Featuring Drake & Tems,"[Intro: Future & Tems]
I will wait for you, for you
Early in the mornin', late at night (I will wait for you)
It don't even matter what time it is (I will wait for you)
Presidential Rollie, already on the way (Higher, sayin' higher-er-er-er)
Whenever I find time, it's okay (Ayy)
(ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)

[Verse 1: Future]
You pray for my demons, girl, I got you
Every time I sip on codeine, I get vulnerable
I'm knowin' the sounds of the storm when it come
She understand I can't take her everywhere a nigga goin'
I been in the field likе the children of the corn

[Chorus: Future & Tems]
I can hеar your tears when they drop over the phone
Get mad at yourself 'cause you can't leave me alone
Gossip, bein' messy, that ain't what we doin' (World was endin')
Travel around the world (Would you cry or would you try to get me?)
Over the phone, droppin' tears (Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah)
I get more vulnerable when I do pills (Tell me now, I need you to be clear, yeah)
When you drunk, you tell me exactly how you feel (I will wait for you, for you)
When I'm loaded, I keep it real (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)
Need to tell a real one exactly what it is (I will wait, will wait, for you, for you)
Don't say it 'cause you know that's what I wanna hear (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)
[Verse 2: Drake & Tems]
Yeah, I been trappin' 'round the world
I sit on my balcony and wonder how you feelin'
I got a career that takes my time away from women
I cannot convince you that I love you for a livin' (Will wait for you, for you)
I be on your line, feeling's flowin' like a river
You be textin' back, you at Kiki on the river (I will wait for you)
Message say delivered, but I know that you don't get it (I will wait for you)
Why you introduce us if you knew that you was with him? (I will wait for you, for you, for you)
Made me shake his hand when y'all been fuckin' for a minute (I will wait for you, for you)
Walk me off the plank because you know that I'm a swimmer (I will wait for you)
Supposed to be your dog, but you done put me in a kennel
Girl, put a muzzle on it, all that barkin' over dinner
I was fuckin' with you when you had the tiny Presidential
You got better when you met me and that ain't coincidental
Tried to bring the best out you, guess I'm not that influential
Guess I'm not the one that's meant for you

[Chorus: Drake, Tems & Future]
I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone
Get mad at myself 'cause I can't leave you alone
Gossip in messages, that ain't what we doin', yeah (World was endin')
Trappin' around the world (Would you cry or would you try to get me?)
Over the phone, droppin' tears (Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah)
I get more vulnerable when I do pills (Tell me now, I need you to be clear, yeah)
When you drunk, you tell me exactly how you feel (I will wait for you, for you)
When I'm loaded, I keep it real (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)
Need to tell a real one exactly what it is (I will wait, will wait, for you, for you)
Don't say it 'cause you know that's what I wanna hear (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)

English,13,Bad Habits,person,Ed Sheeran,Bad Habits by Ed Sheeran,"[Intro]
(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

[Verse 2]
Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
We took the long way 'round
And burned till the fun ran out, now
[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night
Keep me warm, love me long, be my sunlight
Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
Yeah, we did it before, but we'll do it tonight
An afro, black boy with the gold teeth
With dark skin, lookin' at me like he know me
I wonder if he got the G or the B
Let me find out and see, comin' over to me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but

[Chorus]
I want someone to love mе
I need someone who needs me
'Causе it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want

[Verse 2]
Look, you know it's harder to find in these times
But I got nothin' but love on my mind (My mind)
I need a baby with love in my prime
Need an adversary to my ""down and marry""
Like, tell me ""That's life"" when I'm stressin' at night
Be like, ""You'll be okay"" and, ""Everything is alright,"" uh
Let me in that thing, 'cause I'm not wanting anything
But your loving, your body, and a little bit of your brain

[Pre-Chorus]
These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but

[Chorus]
I want someone to love me
I need someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want

[Bridge]
I want someone to love me
I need someone who needs me
[Chorus]
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want

Look out for yourself

[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

[Verse 2: Dan Reynolds]
Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us (Ha)

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & JID]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look; yeah)
(Look out for yourself)

[Bridge: JID]
Uh, look, okay
I'm hopin' that somebody pray for me
I'm prayin' that somebody hope for me
I'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, ""Hasta luego""
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at your throat
[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy

[Outro: Dan Reynolds]
Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint

Wish he could, but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he's toastin' to the most
I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (Ayy), where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turned my haters to supporters, I make vets feel like they juniors (Juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon, but just like Oklahoma (Mmm)
Mine is comin' sooner (Mmm), I'm just a late bloomer (Mmm)
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cooler (Woo)
All these social networks and computers
Got people actin' like they're the real winners

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for (I got what they waiting for)
I don't run from nothing, no
Get your team, tell 'em I ain't layin' low
You were never really rooting for me anyway
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say
He don't run from nothing, no",2022,"Pop

Fuck you and your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

[Verse 1]
I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways

[Pre-Chorus]
I was into you, but I'm ovеr it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so lеt me spell it out

[Chorus]
A-B-C-D-E, F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
A-B-C-D-E, F you

[Verse 2]
You said you just needed space and so I gave it
When I had nothin' to say, you couldn't take it
Told everyone I'm a bitch, so I became it
Always had to put yourself above me

[Pre-Chorus]
I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out

[Chorus]
A-B-C-D-E, F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

[Intro: Bad Bunny & Chencho Corleone]
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, ey
En la guagua se quedó el olor de tu perfume
Tú ere' una bellaca, yo soy un bellaco, eso e' lo que no' une
Ella sabe que está buenota y no la presumen
Si yo fuera tu gato, subiera una foto los vierne' y los lune' (So)

[Coro: Chencho Corleone & Bad Bunny]
Pa' que to' el mundo vea lo rica que tú está', que tú está'
Contigo tengo que apretar
Y еn la calle ando suelto, pero por ti mе quito
Si tú me lo pide', yo me porto bonito
Y subo un selfie pa' que vean lo rica que tú está', que tú está'
Las otras tienen que apretar
En la calle ando suelto, pero por ti me quito
Si tú me lo pide', yo me porto bonito (Ey, ey)

[Verso 1: Bad Bunny]
Tú no ere' bebecita, tú ere' bebesota
Frikitona, ma', se te nota
Le gustan los trío' cuando está en la nota
Si el novio no sirve, de una lo bota
Y wow, mami, dime dónde dejo el résume (Résume)
Sé que te dejaste hace un me' (Ey, ey)
Y de una de pecho me zumbé
Si quiere' te hago un bebé o te traigo la plan B
Uff, mami, qué rica tú te ve'
Pa' los 2000 escuchaba RBD
Y ahora quiere perreo, to'a la noche en la pared
THC, no CBD

[Verso 2: Chencho Corleone & Bad Bunny]
Mami, tú ere' élite (Ey), no te me limite' (Okey)
Déjame hacerte lo que amerite y te levite
Dale pa'l escondite (Ey), no te me arisque' (So)
Que aquí no va a poder llegar lo' satélite' (Oh)
Mami, sube algo, dame contenido
Ese culo súbelo má' seguido
Me paso jangueando, a ver si coincido, ey
Y por fin doy contigo
Mai, nuestra' bellaquera' nunca la' olvido
Ninguna como tú a mí me ha complacido
Tú cree' que a toda' siempre les digo lo mismo
Quiere chingar, pero no quiere na' fijo, ey
Pero en confianza me confiesa
Dice que nadie le interesa
Pero cuando sale, se pone traviesa (Ey)

[Coro: Bad Bunny, Bad Bunny & Chencho Corleone]
Pa' que to' el mundo vea lo rica que tú está', que tú está', ey
Contigo tengo que apretar
Y en la calle ando suelto, pero por ti me quito
Si tú me lo pide', yo me porto bonito",0,2022,"Pop

Hey, woman
Hey, woman

[Chorus]
(Ayy) Woman
Let me be your woman
Woman, woman, woman (Ayy)
I can be your woman
Woman, woman, woman (Ayy)
Let me be your woman
Woman, woman, woman (Ayy)
I can be your woman
Woman, woman, woman (Ayy)

[Verse 1]
What you need?
She give tenfold, come here, papa, plant your seed
She can grow right from her womb a family
Provide lovin' overlooked and unappreciated, you see (Ayy)
You can reciprocate
I got delicious taste, you need a woman's touch in your place
Just protect her and keep her safe
Baby, worship my hips and waist
So feminine with grace
I touch your soul when you hear me say, ""Boy""
Let me be your woman

[Chorus]
Woman (Daddy)
Let mе be your woman (I know, mm)
Woman, woman, woman (Daddy)
I can be your woman (I know)
Woman, woman, woman (Daddy)
Let mе be your woman (I know)
Woman, woman, woman (Ayy; daddy)
I can be your woman (I know)
Woman, woman, woman

[Verse 2]
I can be your lady, I'm a woman
I'm a motherfucker, but they got a problem
Put some babies in your life and take away the drama
Put the paper in a picture like a diorama
Gotta face a lot of people of the opposite
'Cause the world told me, ""We ain't got the common sense""
Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit
And you would never know a god without the goddesses
Honest as fuckin' honest get
And I could be on everything
I mean I could be the leader, head of all the states
I could smile and jiggle it 'til his pockets empty
I could be the CEO, just look at Robyn Fenty
And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl
Don't ever think you ain't hella these niggas dream girl
They wanna pit us against each other
When we succeedin' for no reasons
They wanna see us end up like we Regina on Mean Girls
Princess or queen, tomboy or king (Yeah)
You've heard a lot, you've never seen (Nah)
Mother Earth, Mother Mary rise to the top (Top)
Divine feminine, I'm feminine (Why?)
[Chorus]
Woman (Daddy)
Let me be your woman (Let me be your; I know)
Woman, woman, woman (I need to be your; daddy)
I can be your woman (I know)
Woman, woman, woman (Daddy)
Let me be your woman (I know)
Woman, woman, woman (Daddy)
I can be your woman (I wanna be; I know)
Woman, woman, woman

Hoy tengo a una, mañana otra, ey, pero no hay boda
Tití me preguntó si tengo mucha' novia', je, mucha' novia'
Hoy tengo a una, mañana otra

[Refrán: Bad Bunny]

Que sonrían las que ya les metí
En un VIP, un VIP, ey
Saluden a Tití
Vamo' a tirarno' un selfie, say ""cheese""
Que sonrían las que ya se olvidaron de mí

[Verso 1: Bad Bunny]
Me gustan mucho las Gabriela
Las Patricia, las Nicole, las Sofía
Mi primera novia en kinder, María
Y mi primer amor se llamaba Thalía
Tengo una colombiana que mе escribe to' los día'
Y una mexicana quе ni yo sabía
Otra en San Antonio que me quiere todavía
Y las de PR que todita' son mía'
Una dominicana que es uva bombón
Uva, uva bombón
La de Barcelona que vino en avión
Y dice que mi bicho está cabrón
Yo dejo que jueguen con mi corazón
Quisiera mudarme con toda' pa' una mansión
El día que me case te envío la invitación
Muchacho, deja eso, ey

[Coro: Bad Bunny]
Tití me preguntó si tengo mucha' novia', mucha' novia'
Hoy tengo una, mañana otra, ey, pero no hay boda
Tití me preguntó si tengo mucha' novia', ey, ey, mucha' novia'
Hoy tengo una, mañana otra (Mañana otra; ¡rra!)

[Post-Coro: Bad Bunny & Kiko El Crazy]
Tití me preguntó-tó-tó-tó-tó-tó-tó-tó
Tití me preguntó-tó-tó-tó-tó-tó-tó-tó (Qué pámpara)
Tití me preguntó-tó-tó-tó-tó-tó-tó-tó
Tití me preguntó-tó-tó-tó-tó (Pero ven acá, muchacho, ¿y para qué tú quiere' tanta' novia'?)

Que sonrían las que ya se olvidaron de mí

[Interludio]
Oye, muchacho 'el diablo azaroso
Suelta ese mal vivir que tú tiene' en la calle
Búscate una mujer seria pa' ti
Chacho 'el diablo, coño
[Puente: Bad Bunny]
Yo quisiera enamorarme
Pero no puedo, pero no puedo, eh, eh
Yo quisiera enamorarme
Pero no puedo, pero no puedo

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny]
Sorry, yo no confío, yo no confío
Nah, ni en mí mismo confío
Si quiere' quedarte hoy que hace frío
Y mañana te va', nah
Muchas quieren mi baby gravy
Quieren tener mi primogénito, ey
Y llevarse el crédito
Ya me aburrí, hoy quiero un totito inédito, je
Uno nuevo, uno nuevo, uno nuevo, uno nuevo (Ey)
Hazle caso a tu amiga, ella tiene razón
Yo vo'a romperte el corazón, vo'a romperte el corazón
Ey, no te enamore' de mí (No, no)
No te enamore' de mí (No, no), ey
Sorry, yo soy así (Así, así), ey
No sé por qué soy así (Ey)
Hazle caso a tu amiga, ella tiene razón
Yo vo'a romperte el corazón, vo'a romperte el corazón (Ey, ey)
No te enamore' de mí (No)
No te enamore' de mí (No), no
Sorry, yo soy así
Ya no quiero ser así, no

It doesn't hurt me (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you wanna feel how it feels? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm makin'? (Yeah, yeah, yo)

[Pre-Chorus]
You
It's you and me

[Chorus]
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill
Be runnin' up that buildin'
Say, if I only could, oh

[Verse 2]
You don't wanna hurt me (Yeah, yeah, yo)
But see how deep the bullet lies (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Unaware, I'm tearin' you asunder (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Is there so much hate for the ones we love? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Oh, tell me, we both matter, don't we? (Yeah, yeah, yo)

[Pre-Chorus]
You
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy

[Chorus]
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God

Be runnin' up that hill

It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy (Yeah, yeah, yo)

Oh, come on, baby (Yeah)
Oh, come on, darlin' (Yo)
Let me steal this moment from you now
Oh, come on, angel
Come on, come on, darlin'
Let's exchange the experience (Yo, ooh, ooh)
[Chorus]
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill
With no problems
Say, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places

English,24,We Don't Talk About Bruno,feat,"Carolina Gaitan, Mauro Castillo, Adassa, Rhenzy Feliz, Diane Guerrero, Stephanie Beatriz & Encanto Cast","We Don't Talk About Bruno by Carolina Gaitan, Mauro Castillo, Adassa, Rhenzy Feliz, Diane Guerrero, Stephanie Beatriz & Encanto Cast","[Chorus: Pepa]
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
We don't talk about Bruno, but

[Verse 1: Pepa & Félix]
It was my wedding day (It was our wedding day)
We were getting ready
And there wasn't a cloud in the sky (No clouds allowed in the sky)
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin (Thunder)
You telling this story or am I? (I'm sorry, mi vida, go on)
Bruno says, ""It looks like rain"" (Why did he tell us?)
In doing so, he floods my brain (Abuela, get the umbrellas)
Married in a hurricane (What a joyous day, but anyway)

[Chorus: Pepa & Félix, Dolores]
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no (We don't talk about Bruno, no)
We don't talk about Bruno (Hey)

[Verse 2: Dolores & Camilo]
Grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the sound of falling sand (Ch, ch, ch)
It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
Do you understand?
A seven-foot frame, rats along his back
When he calls your name, it all fades to black
Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams (Hey)

[Chorus: Pepa, Félix & Camilo, Dolores]
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no (No, no)
We don't talk about Bruno (We don't talk about Bruno)

[Verse 3: Ensemble, Señora Pezmuerto, Osvaldo & Townsperson 3]
He told me my fish would die
The next day, dead (No, no)
He told me I'd grow a gut
And just like he said (No, no)
He said that all my hair would disappear
Now, look at my head (No, no)
Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read

[Verse 4: Isabela, Abuela & Dolores]
He told me that the life of my dreams
Would be promised and someday be mine
He told me that my power would grow
Like the grapes that thrive on the vine (Óye, Mariano's on his way)
He told me that the man of my dreams
Would be just out of reach, betrothed to another
It's like I hear him now (Hey, sis)
I want not a sound out of you (It's like I can hear him now)
I can hear him now

[Verse 5: Mirabel, Camilo, Abuela & Isabela]
Um, Bruno
Yeah, about that Bruno
I really need to know about Bruno
Gimme the truth and the whole truth, Bruno
Isabela, your boyfriend's here
Time for dinner
[Verse 6]

[Pepa, Félix, Dolores, Camilo & (Isabela)]
It was my wedding day, we were getting ready; it was our wedding day; grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling, I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling; a seven-foot frame, rats along his back; (He told me that the life of my dreams)

And there wasn't a cloud in the sky; no clouds allowed in the sky; I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch, ch, ch; when he calls your name, it all fades to black; (Would be promised and someday be mine)

Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin; thunder; it's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling, always left Abuela and the family fumbling; yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams; (He told me that my power would grow)

You telling this story or am I?; I'm sorry, mi vida, go on; grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand, do you understand?; (Like the grapes that thrive on the vine, I'm fine)

[Abuela]
Óye, Mariano's on his way

[Pepa, Félix, Dolores, Camilo & (Isabela)]
Bruno says, ""It looks like rain""; why did he tell us?; he told me that the man of my dreams; a seven-foot frame, rats along his back; (He told me that the life of my dreams)

In doing so, he floods my brain; Abuela, get the umbrellas; would be just out of reach, betrothed to another, another; when he calls your name, it all fades to black; (Would be promised and someday be mine)

Married in a hurricane; what a joyous day, but anyway; And I'm fine, and I'm fine, and I'm fine, I'll be fine; yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams; (And I'm fine, and I'm fine, and I'm fine, I'm fine)

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Ooh, girl, I like you, I do
I wanna be your friend, go shoppin' in a Benz
I like you, I do
I’ll hit you when I land, can you fit me in your plans?
I like you, I do
We went to bed in France, then we woke up in Japan
I like you, I do (I do), mm

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Oh, girl, I know you only like it fancy (Fancy)
So I pull up in that Maybach Candy
Yeah, your boyfriend'll never understand me (Understand)
'Cause I’m 'bout to pull his girl like a hammy, hammy (Wow)
Let's take a lil' dip, lil' lady
Hit PCH, 180
Hey, I been thinkin' lately
That I need someone to save me
Now that I'm famous, I got hoes all around me
But I need a good girl, I need someone to ground me
So, please be truе, don't fuck around with me
I need someone to sharе this heart with me
Fill you up, then run it back again (Run it back again)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Ooh, girl, I like you, I do (I do)

Let me know when you're free
’Cause I been tryna hit it all week, babe
Why you actin' all sweet?
I know that you want little ol' me
I get a little OD, but ain't shit new to a freak
Let me drop bands, put a jewel in ya teeth
He love the way I drip, turn that pool to the beach
And I coulda copped a Birkin but I cop Celine
Why we got the same taste for the finer things?
Brand new nigga with the same old team
Now he got me on a leash ’cause he said no strings
You know I'm cool with that
Stole the pussy, you ain't get sued for that (Get sued, sued)
Wonder what a nigga might do for that (Do, might do)
I could be your Chaka, where Rufus at? (Where?)
80 in the Benz when that roof go back, ayy
They don't wanna see us get too attached
I just got a feelin' that we might be friends for a long, long time
You don't mind and you know I like you for that

Made a move, could've made a move
If I knew I'd be with you
Is it too late to pursue?

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
I bite my tongue, it's a bad habit
Kinda mad that I didn't take a stab at it
Thought you were too good for me, my dear
Never gave me time of day, my dear
It's okay, things happen for
Reasons that I think are sure, yeah

Please say to me (Please just say to me)
If you still want it
I wish you wouldn't play with me
I wanna know (I wanna know)

Can I bite your tongue like my bad habit?
Would you mind if I tried to make a pass at it?
No, you're not too good for me, my dear
Funny you come back to me, my dear

I'm everywhere, I'm cross-eyed, and (I wish I knew you wanted me)
Now that you're back, I can't decide (I wish I knew)
If I decide if you're invited (I wish I knew you wanted me)
You always knew the way to wow me
Fuck around, get tongue-tied, and
I turn it on, I make it rowdy
Then carry on, but I'm not hidin'
You grabbin' me hard 'cause you know what you found
It's biscuits, it's gravy, babe

[Outro: Steve Lacy, Steve Lacy & Fousheé]
You can't surprise a Gemini
But you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
I knew you'd come back around
'Cause you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
Let's fuck in the back of the mall, lose control
Go stupid, go crazy, babe
I know I'll be in your heart 'til the end
You'll miss me, don't beg me, babe",0,2022,"Pop

You got those pretty eyes in your head, you know it
You got me dancin' in my bed, so let me show it
You are exactly what I want, kinda cool and kinda not
Wanna give myself to you

Na-na-na-na, na-na
Na-na-na-na, oh no
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Post Malone]
Said you love me, but I don't care
That I broke my hand on the same wall
That you told me that he fucked you on (Oh)
You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings
I got one comin' over and one right now (Uh)
One right now
(One right now, one right now, oh)
I got one comin' over and one right now

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Said you wanna have my babies
I fucked you so good, you should pay me
Don't call me ""baby"" when you did me so wrong
(When you did me so wrong)
But I got over what you did already
Body for a body, I’m so petty
How many of your friends fit in my Rolls? (Can you fit in my Rolls?)
Bought you a new face, you should call me ""Dad,"" baby
Hermès, but you dropped the bag, baby
Truth is, maybe one's just not еnough

[Chorus: Post Malone & The Weeknd]
You say you love me, but I don't care
That I brokе my hand on the same wall
That you told me that he fucked you on (That he fucked you on)
You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings (Feelings)
I got one comin' over and one right now (Uh)
One right now (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(One right now, one right now, oh yeah)
I got one comin' over and one right now (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(One right now, one right now, oh)
I got one comin' over and one right now

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
You're a stain on my legacy
We can't be friends, can't be family (Oh)
You probably fuck all my enemies (Oh)
I can't let you be next to me
Oh, you belong to the world now
So just leave me alone now
We're not in touch no more

[Chorus: Post Malone & The Weeknd, Post Malone, The Weeknd]
You say you love me, but I don't care (No, I don't care)
That I broke my hand on the same wall
That you told me that he fucked you on (Oh)
You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings (Feelings)
I got one comin' over and one right now
One right now (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Fuckin' with my, fuckin' with my feelings)
I got one comin' over and one right now

(Ah)

[Verse 1]
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (Girl)

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Verse 2]
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Break]
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

English,32,Numb Little Bug,person,Em Beihold,Numb Little Bug by Em Beihold,"[Verse 1]
I don't feel a single thing
Have the pills done too much?
Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
And now we're outta touch
I've been drivin' in L.A
And the world, it feels too big
Like a floating ball that's bound to break
Snap my psyche like a twig

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just wanna see
If you feel the same as me

[Chorus]
Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair?

[Post-Chorus]
A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin', there's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin', tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope
Guess I'm just broken and broke

[Verse 2]
The prescription's on its way
With a name I can't pronounce
And the dose I gotta take
Boy, I wish that I could count

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna see
If this could make me happy

[Chorus]
Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair?

[Post-Chorus]
A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin', there's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin', tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope
[Outro]
Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like a numb little bug that's gotta survive
That's gotta survive",0,2022,"Rock

Just awaken shaken once again, so you know it's on
Just awaken shaken once again, ho, you know it's on
Just awaken shaken once again, so you know it's on
Just awaken shaken once again, ho, you know it's on
Yeah, life
Life is the only thing we need
They need me to go, but I don't wanna leave
Rest in peace to Lil Keed

[Verse 1: Drake]
Fuck a pigeonhole, I'm a night owl, this a different mode
I might have to make her paint a 6 on her pinky toe
Heard you with a shooting guard, just let a nigga know
I would have you courtside, not the middle row
All good, love, in a minute, though
I can't strеss about no bitch 'cause I'm a timid soul
Plus I'm cookin' up ambition on a kitchen stove
Pot start to bubblе, see the suds, that shit good to go
Hoes say I'm suave, but I can't get RICO'd
Bro think he John Wayne, I bought him yellow stones
Love the way they hang, babe, fuck the silicone
Everybody fake now, you could crack the code
Bustdown everything, set in rose gold
Dread talkin' to you niggas like I'm J. Cole
I can tell her head good before I even know
Bitch, don't tell me that you model if you ain't been in Vogue
Gotta throw a party for my day ones
They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'
Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'
You don't like the way I talk? Nigga, say somethin'
Gotta throw a party for my day ones
Pull up and you know it's us, the bass jumpin'
You don't like the way I talk? Then say somethin'
Get out my face, nigga

[Chorus: Drake & 21 Savage]
Gotta throw a party for my day ones
They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'
Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'
If I let my nigga 21 tell it, you a
Pussy

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Spin a block twice like it ain't nowhere to park (21)
Smack the backside of his head like he Bart (Pussy)
OVO 4L, we come out when it get dark (21, 21)
Big stepper, he came in a Rolls, but he left in a stretcher (21)
Let my brother drive while I shoot, team effort (21)
Askin' all these questions, bitch, you must think you Nadeska
The chopper like to feel on all the opps, it's a molester (21)
I be with my gun like Rozay be with lemon pepper
She wanna hear some Afrobeats 'cause she just popped a Tesla
All that workin' out, that nigga must think he a wrestler
But this ain't UFC, this chopper came with a compressor (21)
This chopper came with a compressor (Pussy)
This chopper came with a— (Pussy)
This Glock 45 came with a switch (21)
If I was Will Smith, I would've slapped him with a stick
Put your hands in the air, it's a stick-up (21)
Spin the same hood where I get my dick sucked (Facts)
If you standin' on business, put your blick up (21, 21)
Come around actin' scary, get your shit took (21)
Fell in love with feelin' dizzy, so I spizzin (21)
I got mad love for the boy, yeah, that's my twizzin (21)
If them niggas keep on dissin', slide agaizzin (21)
We the reason why the opps ain't got no frizziends (21)
Last nigga played with me got turned duppy
I ain't even roll him in the 'Wood 'cause he musty
You ask how she doin', I just tell her come and fuck me
Shot his ass twenty times, damn, this nigga lucky (Damn, that nigga lucky)
[Chorus: Drake]
Gotta throw a party for my day ones
They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'
Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'

People say I'm smooth, but I can't get caught up
Bro think he John Wayne, I got him yellow stones
Love the way they hang, babe, keep it all your own
Everybody’s fake now, you could crack the code
Everything shining, set in rose gold
Speaking to you like I’m J. Cole
I can tell she’s smart before I even know
Please don’t tell me that you model if you ain’t been in Vogue
Gotta throw a party for my day ones
They ain’t in the studio, but they’ll lay somethin'

Let my brother drive while I take aim, team effort
Askin’ all these questions, you must think you’re clever
The chopper feels the tension, it’s a detector
I be with my buddy like Rozay with lemon pepper
She wanna hear some beats 'cause she just had a good time
All that workin’ out, he must think he’s a fighter
But this isn’t the ring, this one has a silencer
This one has a—
This Glock 45 has a switch
If I was Will Smith, I would've handled it quick
Put your hands in the air, it’s a stick-up
Spin the same hood where I get my business done
If you standin’ on principles, raise it up
Come around actin’ tough, get your stuff taken
Fell in love with the thrill, so I keep goin’
I got mad love for the crew, yeah, that’s my squad
If they keep on hatin', slide back on 'em
We the reason why they ain’t got no peace
Last guy messed around, got dealt with
I didn’t even roll him in the 'Wood 'cause he wasn’t worth it
You ask how she’s doin’, I just tell her to come hang
Handled it twenty times, guess that guy’s lucky

You can tell your old man you'll do some large-mouth fishin' another time
You just got too much on your plate to bait and cast a line
You can always put a rain check in his hand
'Til you can't

[Verse 2]
You can keep puttin' off forever with that girl who's heart you hold
Swearin' that you'll ask someday further down the road
You can always put a diamond on her hand
'Til you can't

[Chorus]
If you got a chance take it
Take it while you got a chance
If you got a dream chase it
'Cause a dream won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody
Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can
'Til you can't

[Verse 3]
There's a box of greasy parts sittin' in the trunk of that sixty-five
Still waitin' on you and your grandad to bring it back to life
You can always get around to fixin' up that Pontiac
'Til you can't

If you got a chance take it
Take it while you got a chancе
If you got a dream chase it
'Cause a drеam won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody

So take that phone call from your mama
Just talk away
'Cause you'll never know how bad you wanna

Don't wait on tomorrow 'cause tomorrow may not show
Say your sorry's, I love you's
'Cause, man, you never know

If you got a chance take it
Take it while you got a chance
If you got a dream chase it
'Cause a dream won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody
Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can

Ayy
My girl is bangin', she's so low maintenance
Don't need no champagne-poppin' entertainment
Take her to Wendy's, can't keep her off me
She wanna dip me like them fries in her Frosty

[Pre-Chorus]
But every now and then, when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (Yeah)
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got some Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top, too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home
With some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (Hey)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Fancy like, ooh
Fancy like, ooh
Fancy like, ooh

[Verse 2]
Uh
Don't need no Tesla to impress her (Don't need no Tesla to impress her)
My girl is happy rollin' on a Vespa (There she go)
Don't need no mansion to get romancin' (Ooh, woo)
She's super fine, double wide, slow dancin' (Slow dancin')

[Pre-Chorus]
But every now and then, when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (Yeah)

Got some Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake (Ayy)
Get some whipped cream on the top, too (Gotta add that whipped cream)
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you (Girl, I got you)
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam (Styrofoam)
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home (All the way home)
With some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (Hey)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like

[Bridge]
My new, clean blue jeans without the holes in 'em
Country kisses on my lips without the Skoal in 'em
Yeah, she probably gon' be keepin' some Victoria's Secrets
Maybe a little Maybelline but she don't need it
In the kitchen light, radio slows down
Boxed wine, then her up-do goes down

We've been burnin' both ends
Keepin' the lights on
So I've been thinkin' we need
A little time alone

[Pre-Chorus]
So what you say we cancel our plans?
Tonight I'm only gonna be your man

[Chorus]
Let's get some candles burning
And some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make

[Verse 2]
There ain't no way, baby
To get me out this house
When you look this good
What could I even think about? Oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Besides turn around and lockin' the door
Watching your red dress fall to the floor

[Chorus]
Let's get some candles burning
And some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make

Got no regrets even when I am broke (Yeah)

Way too busy for them problems and problems to feel (Yeah, yeah)
No stressing, just obsessing with sealing the deal

I'ma let down my hair 'cause I lost my mind
Bey is back and I'm sleepin' real good at night
The queens in the front and the Doms in the back
Ain't takin' no flicks but the whole clique snapped
There's a whole lot of people in the house
Tryin' to smoke with the yak in your mouth

In case you forgot how we act outside

If you don't seek it, you won't see it

If you don't think it, you won't be it
That love ain't yours (Can't break my soul)
Tryin' to fake it never makes it
That, we all know (Can't break my soul)
You can have the stress and not take less
I'll justify love
We go 'round in circles, 'round in circles
Searchin' for love ('Round in circles)
We go up and down, lost and found ('Round in circles)
Searchin' for love (Yeah)
Looking for something that lives inside me
Looking for something that lives inside me

English,39,Something In The Orange,person,Zach Bryan,Something In The Orange by Zach Bryan,"[Verse 1]
It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

[Verse 2]
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

[Chorus]
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

[Verse 3]
I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

[Chorus]
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

[Chorus]
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you

But now she got me smokin' out the window
Mm, mm, mm

[Verse 1: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak]
Must've spent thirty-five, forty-five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh no)
Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib
Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (Woah, woah)
Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC
Can't believe it (Can't believe it)
I'm in disbelief

And here I am all alone (All alone)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
You got me out here

Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (Mmm)
But I was wrong
'Cause she belong
To everybody, everybody, ooh

Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight
Screamin', ""Hercules"" (Hercules, Hercules)

Someone help me, please (Help me, please, help me, please)
Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl?
Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die

But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets
Look out

Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back)
To the city, oh, you got me

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

[Verse 2]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

[Post-Chorus]
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm levitating (Woo)
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo)

[Bridge]
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading

[Chorus]
I got you (Yeah), moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night (All night), come on, dance with me
I'm levitating (Woo)

You can fly away with me tonight (Tonight)
You can fly away with me tonight

(Damn, Kai, you goin' crazy)

[Verse 1]
I be in the loop, she be in a group (Yeah)
Brodie want her friend, throw 'em alley-oop (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with Mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, ""Baby keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco
AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

[Verse 2]
Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at
[Chorus]
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real

Now look how I'm livin', I bought a house for the funds to stay at

[Intro]
Si yo no te escribo, tú no me escribe', ey
Si tú quieres, te busco, yo sé dónde tú vive'
Quizá hoy está aborrecía'
Pero por dentro tú tiene' alegría

[Coro]
Si quieres te la saco
Dos trago' y sabes que me pongo bellaco
No somo' na', pero estamo' envuelto' hace rato, oh-oh
WhatsApp sin el retrato, no guarda mi contacto (¡Ey, ey, ey, ey!)
Pero se la saco
Dos trago' y sabes que me pongo bellaco
No somo' na', pero estamo' envuelto' hace rato, oh-oh
WhatsApp sin el retrato, no guarda mi contacto-to

[Verso 1]
Todo e' underwater (Ey)
Baby, vamo' pa'l cuarto quarter
En la Uru' comiéndono' el pare
Te vo'a dar duro pa' que no me compare', ey
Cuida'o con ese mahón, que se va a romper (Ey)
Ese booty lo va a romper (Ey)
Yo no sé si yo te vuelvo a ver
Si mañana me vo'a perder
Tú ere' una player, me hiciste un crossover
Esta ve' metiste, me diste game over, eh-eh (Huh)
Porque no puedo olvidar
El perreo aquel que se fue viral
Dime si mañana te va' a quedar
Después de la alarma te lo voy a dar, ey
Hoy tú no va' a trabajar, jeje, no

Pero aún te debo una noche en la suite
Pa' darte tabla; dale, mami, habla
Tú ere' una diablona, no te haga'
Pa' darte tabla; dale, mami, habla
Tú ere' una diablona, no te haga'

Ey, yo no sé tú, pero yo quisiera amanecer esnú'
En una playa por Bali, si no, Cancún
Pide otro moscow mule (Ey)
[Verso 3]
Que ando en nota, nota

And it's me and you, no she
Tryna be all through your sheets
Have you all on top of me
Actin' like it's not that deep
Oh, you could take it out on me
Tell me what it's 'bout to be
Really feel it's bound to bе
I can't tell no one, but they all know

(Heads Carolina, tails California)

[Verse 1]
I was out with the boys, catchin' up in a neon light
Didn't know 'til we walked in it was karaoke night
She was in a circle of girls, chasin' a shot with a lime
She was laughin', they were darin' her to get on the mic
One of 'em walked up and turned in her name
Next thing I knew, man, she was up on the stage, singin'

[Chorus]
""Heads Carolina, tails California""
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive hеr anywhere from herе to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at ""Heads Carolina""

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she knew every word by heart, didn't need no screen, no
I was raisin' my glass up for her, I saw her smilin' at me, yeah
She had me down in the front by the end of verse two
Like there wasn't no one else in the room, we were singin'
[Chorus]
""Heads Carolina, tails California""
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive her anywhere from here to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at ""Heads Carolina""

[Bridge]
Yeah, I bought her a round and we talked 'til the lights came on
I still see that girl every time I hear that song

[Chorus]
""Heads Carolina, tails California""
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive her anywhere from here to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at ""Heads Carolina""

[Outro]
(Heads Carolina, tails California)
Yeah, she had me at ""Heads Carolina"" (Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer)
(Heads Carolina, tails California)
Yeah (Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer)

Two fingers up, one down when my toes ten
Flewed out with my boobs out, put a cork in it
Love it when you be cryin' out when I'm corseted
I don't think he gon' make it, do not let me start ragin'
****, I'm losin' my patience, this ain't stayin' in Vegas (You ain't nothin' but a)
There's more sides to the story, I'ma tell everybody
Had your ass sittin' courtside with your arm around me
Had your ass sittin' first class with your burnt ass out in Abu Dhabi
Coulda been what we shoulda been
But you lost a bet, now you gotta find me
Find a seat
I ain't playin', that's hide and seek

And I get it, you needed someone that could prove you wrong
So I reckon you leave all of your problems at the door to my city
You gon' need to tell my brothers where you from
And I admit it, I still got empathy
And you gon' feel it for two weeks when I release you in them sheets (You ain't nothin' but a)
And keep my nina indiscreet, keep the cleaner in my Jeep
Then put that Yeezy in your teeth, let my demons off they leashes
If you even think to speak, I'ma give a whole new meanin'
When you said you livin' a dream, we can keep that **** asleep
And you gon' laugh with all your Gs
Countin' them sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep
Talkin' 'bout Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z, R.I.P

English,49,Buy Dirt,feat,Jordan Davis Featuring Luke Bryan,Buy Dirt by Jordan Davis Featuring Luke Bryan,"[Verse 1: Jordan Davis]
Few days before he turned 80
He was sitting out back in a rocker
He said ""What you been up to lately?""
I told him chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out
Said ""If you want my two cents on making a dollar count

[Chorus: Jordan Davis]
Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt""

[Verse 2: Luke Bryan]
Before you get caught on that ladder
Let me tell you what it's all about
Find you a few things that matter
That you can put a fence around
And then he laid it out
[Chorus: Jordan Davis & Luke Bryan]
Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send you prayers up and your roots down deep
And add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt

[Bridge: Jordan Davis & Luke Bryan]
You can buy dirt
And thank the good Lord for it
'Cause He ain't makin' any more of it

[Chorus: Jordan Davis, Luke Bryan, Both]
So buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness

English,50,I Hate U,person,SZA,I Hate U by SZA,"[Verse 1]
I be so sick of you niggas, y'all contradicting
I be so bored with myself, can you come and fuck me?
I feel so ordinary, sad when you around me
Treat me like corduroy, wear me out
Arguments, you air me out
Tripping 'bout your whereabouts
I can't keep no conflict with you, boy, can we just rub it out?
I don't want no static with you, you know you my plug
And I can't shake this habit, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missing you
Wish it was different than what it was (Oh, no)
I've been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us
I've been up, baby

[Chorus]
And if you wonder if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just likе this
What I would do to make you feel just like this
[Verse 2]
Used to bе too solid 'til you scrambled me
Used to be your rider, you mishandle me
Used to be nonviolent 'til you ambushed me
Now I'm out here wildin' with you
Now I'm out here, silent treatment, that mean no permission (No)
Missionary gettin' boring, can you switch positions? (Yeah)
Hard to save your soul, you don't ever listen, no (No)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missing you
Wish it was different than what it was (Oh, no)
I've been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us
I've been up, baby

[Chorus]
And if you wonder if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this

I can't believe we're finally alone
I can't believe I almost went home
What are the chances? Everyone's dancing
And he's not with you (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
The universe must have divined this
What am I gonna do? Not grab your wrist?

[Chorus]
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit

[Post-Chorus]
I could be a better boyfriend

I don't need to tell you twice
All the ways hе can't suffice
If I could give you some advicе
I would leave with me tonight

The universe must have divined this (Mmm, mmm)
Ladies first, baby, I insist

Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman

I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could be a better boyfriend

[Bridge]
I never would have left you alone
Here on your own, glued to your phone
Never would have left you alone
For someone else to take you home

I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
I'm gonna steal you from him

She'd take the world off my shoulders
If it was ever hard to move
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
When I was living in the blue
Why then, if she's so perfect
Do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's workin'
So what can I do? (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're out of sight
In my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinkin' of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us

[Verse 2]
Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?
One that I had never lived
Maybe one day, you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slippin' slowly and find me again
[Pre-Chorus]
When you're out of sight
In my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinkin' of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us

English,53,Surface Pressure,person,Jessica Darrow,Surface Pressure by Jessica Darrow,"[Intro]
I'm the strong one, I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the Earth is
I move mountains, I move churches
And I glow, 'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is
Got a rough, indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum, I find 'em, I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but

[Verse 1]
Under the surface
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like, ""Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus?""
Under the surface
I'm pretty surе I'm worthless if I can't be of servicе

[Pre-Chorus]
A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back
What breaks the camel's back, it's

[Chorus]
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer
Who am I if I can't carry it all?
If I falter
[Verse 2]
Under the surface
I hide my nerves and it worsens, I worry somethin' is gonna hurt us
Under the surface
The ship doesn't swerve, has it heard how big the iceberg is?
Under the surface
I think about my purpose, can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominoes, a light wind blows
You try to stop it tumbling, but on and on it goes

[Bridge]
But wait, if I could shake the crushing weight of expectations
Would that free some room up for joy
Or relaxation, or simple pleasure?
Instead, we measure this growing pressure
Keeps growing, keep going, 'cause all we know is

[Chorus]
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt and
See if she can handle every family burden
Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
No mistakes, just
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister and never wonder
If the same pressure would've pulled you under
Who am I if I don't have what it takes?
No cracks, no breaks
No mistakes, no pressure!",0,2022,"Pop

Just like you always said we would
Packed your bags in that old 4Runner
That I bought you when things were good
I'm glad to see the stop sign didn't hit ya
Bring you back to your senses
Oh, it waved you gone, goodbye
Yeah, it waved you gone, goodbye

[Verse 2]
I heard you found yourself a brand-new man
Put a rock on your finger and he vowed you a second chance
Built a house right by the coast
That ocean view is beautiful, but baby, I just want you to know
He don't know you like I did
Money talks, but I ain't buyin'

[Chorus]
'Cause love's a smoke ring wrapped around your finger
One second, it's a blessin', and the next, it's already gone
A broken heart, I'm a walkin' testimony
My confession is a lesson that I'm pourin' out in this song
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
You don't wanna fall in love
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
You don't wanna fall in love
[Verse 3]
I seen your mama walkin' out the county market
And I stopped to ask her how she's been
Said she's missin' ya and tried to go convincin' ya
Not to settle down with him
She ain't wrong, the whole town knows it
You had a bed of roses, but girl, you couldn't walk that line
You can act like you're doin' fine

[Chorus]
'Cause love's a smoke ring wrapped around your finger
One second, it's a blessin', and the next, it's already gone
A broken heart, I'm a walkin' testimony
My confession is a lesson that I'm pourin' out in this song
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
You don't wanna fall in love
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
You don't wanna fall in love

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
'Cause love's a smoke ring wrapped around your finger
One second, it's a blessin', and the next, it's already gone
A broken heart, I'm a walkin' testimony
My confession is a lesson that I'm pourin' out in this song
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
You don't wanna fall in love
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
You don't wanna fall in love
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
You don't wanna fall in love
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah

His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive

Uh, oh, ooh, mmm (Yeah)
I don't usually do this but, um (Tiller, oh my God, hm-hm)
Can I sing to you?
Yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Yours, mine, ours
I could do this for hours
Sit and talk to you for hours
I wanna give you your flowers
And some champagne showers
Order shrimp and lobster towers
But it's me that gets devoured
Ooh, when you do what you do, I'm empowered
You give me a superpower
Together the world could be ours
You sit me up on the counter
Instantly, it's thunder showers
Stormin' for a couple hours
When we finished, take a shower

[Chorus]
I could do this for hours
And hours and hours
I could do this for hours
And hours and hours
I could do this for hours
And hours and hours
I could do this for hours
And hours, hours, I
[Verse 2]
Usually don't like nobody
And when I say nobody
I mеan nobody
All these niggas full of shit
You're just thе homie once they hit
Felt like givin' up on love
These niggas almost made me quit
Then I met you
When I met you
I knew this was it
I've never been in love like this
A love like ours
I pray for it on my knees
Every night for some hours
And hours and hours
And hours and hours
And hours

[Chorus]
I could do this for hours
And hours and hours
I could do this for hours
And hours and hours
What's yours is mine
And ours
And yours, mine and ours
[Bridge]
I could sit and talk to you for hours
Sit and look at you for hours
Makin' love to you for hours
Layin' on your chest for hours
Tellin' you jokes for hours
Holdin' you close for hours
And hours and hours

English,58,Sand In My Boots,person,Morgan Wallen,Sand In My Boots by Morgan Wallen,"[Verse 1]
She asked me where I's from
I said, ""Somewhere ya never been to
Little town outside of Knoxville""
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water, she left her flip-flops
By my Red Wings on the beach

[Chorus]
Yeah, but now I'm dodgin' potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissеd me
Tells me shе'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Let's go shoot tequila""
So, we walked back to that beach bar
She said, ""Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"" (Huh)
So, we drank bottom shelf
She said, ""Damn, that sky looks perfect""
I said, ""Girl, you've never seen stars
Like the ones back home""
And she said, ""Maybe I should, see 'em for myself""
[Chorus]
Yeah, but now I'm dodgin' potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me
Tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots

[Bridge]
I said, ""Meet me in the mornin'""
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up

[Chorus]
Aw, but now I'm dodgin' potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
Headed right back to my roots

[Intro: KAROL G & Becky G]
O-O-Ovy On The Drums
Salud, mami
Ah, ah, ah, ay

[Pre-Coro: Becky G & KAROL G]
Lo que no sirve que no estorbe
Te metiste autogol por torpe
Te quedó grande este torque
Ya no estoy pa' que de mí te enamores, baby (Chi)
Sin Visa ni pasaporte (No)
Mandé tu falso amor de vacaciones (Chi, chi, chi, chi, chi, chi)
Pa' la mierda y nunca vuelvas
Que todo se te devuelva, no
De lo que me hiciste si no te acuerda'

[Coro: KAROL G & Becky G]
No me vuelvas a llamar, que hasta boté el cеlular
De lo tóxico que erеs, se volvió perjudicial
Lo que se va, se va
Conmigo no te equivoques
De lo tóxico que eres, no te quiero ver más (Chi)

[Verso 1: Becky G]
Llegué pa'l party, saca la botella
La que te quería, no sé quién es ella
Te dejé el review, no te puse ni una estrella
Y te olvidé porque no dejaste huella
Ya no miro pa'trás, ni pa' parquearme
Tengo a uno que está listo pa' llevarme
El segundo está esperando en el hotel
Y el tercero lo conozco esta noche (No, no)
No me llames, que mi número cambié (Cambié)
Si quieres que te lo dé (Dé)
Llama 1-800-jódete
No sé si me escuchaste
No me llames, que mi número cambié (Cambié)
Si quieres que te lo dé (Dé)
Llama 1-800-jódete (Jódete)
[Coro: Becky G & KAROL G]
No me vuelvas a llamar, hasta boté el celular
De lo tóxico que eres, se volvió perjudicial
Lo que se va, se va, ah-ah
Conmigo no te equivoques
De lo tóxico que eres, no te quiero ver más (Ey)

[Verso 2: KAROL G & Becky G]
Ay, yo lo lamento (Ah)
Tu' gana' de volver (Ey) murieron en el intento (Ah)
Lo hiciste ver como que perdiste el tiempo
Quedaste bien porque lo mío ni lo cuento (Papi)
Te veo en la' rede', no puedo creerlo, qué pena de ti (Pena de ti)
Yo que fui buena y tú qué gonorrea pagándome así (Nea, qué gonorrea)
Rata de dos patas, lo dijo Paquita
Un animal rastrero (Jaja)
Que se come todo lo que se atraviesa
Diablo, tú ere' un cuero (Cuero)
No digas ""Te quiero,"" mejor sé sincero (Ey)
No digas ""Te amo"" (Ah) porque eso fue en vano (Ah)
Llorando estaba' tú y como no te salí
Andas comiéndote a otra, pero estás pensando en mí (Chi)

[Coro: Becky G & KAROL G, Becky G]
No me vuelvas a llamar, hasta boté el celular
De lo tóxico que eres, se volvió perjudicial
Lo que se va, se va, ah-ah
Conmigo no te equivoques
De lo tóxico que eres, no te quiero ver más
[Outro: Becky G & KAROL G]
Ouh
Repítelo, mami
""Que a veces no te cambian por algo mejor
Y ni siquiera por algo más rico""

English,60,Knife Talk,feat,Drake Featuring 21 Savage & Project Pat,Knife Talk by Drake Featuring 21 Savage & Project Pat,"[Intro: Project Pat & 21 Savage]
I gotta feed the streets, my pistol gon' bleed the streets
Ski mask on my face, sometimes you got to cheat
To stay ahead in this bitch-ard (Gang), drank syrup like it's liquor
Street life'll have you catchin' up to God quicker (Yeah, gang)
Sticker, AK-40 to your liver
Let the chopper bang on you like a Blood or a Cripper (Gang)
Flipper, so much bread, I'm a gymnast
Made so much money off of dummies, off of dummies (Yeah, gang)

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I'm mister body catcher (Gang), Slaughter Gang soul snatcher
Ain't no regular F-150, this a fuckin' Raptor (Yeah, gang)
No capper, street nigga, not a rapper
Chopper hit him and he turned into a booty clapper (Gang)
Smith & Wesson, I'm 4L Gang reppin'
We done baptizеd more niggas than the damn revеrend (Yeah, gang)
Kappa Alpha, me and my gang, we do all the steppin'
Who you checkin'? This FN shoot East to West End (Gang)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
I heard Papi outside
And he got the double-R droppy outside
Checked the weather and it's gettin' real oppy outside
I'ma drop this shit and have these pussies droppin' like some motherfuckin' flies
Type of nigga that can't look me in the eyes
I despise
When I see you, better put that fuckin' pride to the side
Many times, plenty times, I survived
Beef is live, spoiler alert, this nigga dies
[Verse 3: 21 Savage]
Keep blickies, and you know the weed sticky
My finger itchy, the Glock like to leave hickeys
Your shooters iffy, a street punk could never diss me
I come straight up out the 6, and we don't spare sissies

[Verse 4: Drake]
I fuck with her, and fuck with her, and her
I hit up err, tell him do the err, for sure
Voodoo curse, it got him while I flew to Turks
Know the dogs had to hit them where we knew it hurts

[Chorus: 21 Savage & Drake]
Gang shit, that's all I'm on (Yeah)
Gang shit, that's all I'm on
Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on
Gang shit, that's all I'm on
Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on
Gang shit, that's all I'm on
Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on
Gang shit, that's all I'm on

[Verse 5: 21 Savage & Drake]
Let it bang, bang, let it bang, bang
'Til his brains hang and his mama sang
And the pastor sang (Woo) and them bullets sang (Yee)
And them choppers sang (Yee) and the choir sang
[Verse 6: Drake]
I'm on everything
Jacob charged me four-fifty for a tennis chain
US Open, had it on us at the tennis game
Tell the coach don't take me out, I like to finish games
And my pen insane, am I menacin'?
There's like eighty of us now, that's the scary thing
Shit they doin' on that other side embarrassing
We in Paris with it, hundred carats with it
All this shit is for my son, 'cause he's inheritin' it

[Interlude: 21 Savage]
If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
Gang
Metro

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Gang shit, that's all I'm on
Gang shit, that's all I'm on
Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on
Gang shit, that's all I'm on
Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on
Gang shit, that's all I'm on
Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on
Gang shit, that's all I'm on, yeah","[Intro: Project Pat & 21 Savage]
I gotta support the streets, my role's to help the streets
Masked up for the job, sometimes you need to bend the rules
To stay ahead in this game (Gang), moving smooth like it’s easy
Street life will have you catching up to time quicker (Yeah, gang)
Focused, securing my place, making progress
So much success, it feels like a triumph (Yeah, gang)

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I'm the one who handles business (Gang), with a team that’s fierce
Not a regular truck, it’s a special edition (Yeah, gang)
No pretending, street life’s my reality, not just talk
Handling matters with precision, making a mark (Gang)
We’ve helped many, more than even the most dedicated (Yeah, gang)
With my team, we handle things, making sure everything’s covered (Gang)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
I heard the news
And it’s a big deal, things are changing fast
Checked the situation and it’s getting intense outside
I’m going to release this and have things shift quickly
The kind of person who doesn’t back down
I hold my ground
When I see you, set aside the pride
Many times, I’ve come through
Conflicts are real, just a heads up, it’s a serious matter

[Verse 3: 21 Savage]
Keeping vigilant, and the situation’s clear
My attention’s sharp, and the strategy’s strong
Your team might be uncertain, a challenge isn’t worth it
I’m from the 6, and we don’t back down

[Verse 4: Drake]
I’m involved, and involved with more
I reach out and make things happen, for sure
Focused on the goals, making things work
The team had to act where it mattered

[Chorus: 21 Savage & Drake]
Teamwork, that’s what I focus on (Yeah)
Teamwork, that’s what I focus on
Teamwork, that’s what I focus on
Teamwork, that’s what I focus on
Teamwork, that’s what I focus on
Teamwork, that’s what I focus on
Teamwork, that’s what I focus on
Teamwork, that’s what I focus on

[Verse 5: 21 Savage & Drake]
Make an impact, let it show
Until the message is clear, and the results are known
And the response is felt, and the outcome is seen
And the team is in sync, and the plan is set

[Verse 6: Drake]
I’m on top of everything
Jacob’s design, a high-value piece
At the event, showcasing with style
Tell the coach to keep me in, I like to complete tasks
And my strategy’s sharp, am I effective?
We’ve grown a lot, which can be overwhelming
What others do doesn’t match up
We’re in Paris, with high standards
All this effort is for my future, to pass it on

[Interlude: 21 Savage]
If there’s doubt, I’ll step in
Team
Metro

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Teamwork, that’s what I focus on
Teamwork, that’s what I focus on
Teamwork, that’s what I focus on
Teamwork, that’s what I focus on
Teamwork, that’s what I focus on
Teamwork, that’s what I focus on
Teamwork, that’s what I focus on
Teamwork, that’s what I focus on, yeah

One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Alright
Coffee cup, cold and black
Wish you had a little shot of jack
Besides that, can't complain
Just tryin' to do the dang thing
Might change the oil in my truck
I ain't payin' no thirty-five bucks
Kids need shoes, mama needs Levi's

[Chorus]
And I'm just tryna keep my daughters off the pole
And my sons out of jail
Tryna get to church so I don't go to hell
I'm just tryna keep my wife from figuring out
That I married up and she married way, way down
In Alabama where they love Nick Saban
Tryna write a song the local country station will play
Hey, I'm just tryna stay out of AA (AA, ooh)

[Verse 2]
Well I gave up Skoal and cigarettes
Now I'm just hooked on Nicorette
Trying not to be like my old man
But the older I get, the more I am
Tryna get paid and a little love made, y'all
Hey, y'all, at the end of the day, y'all
I'm just another John Deere guy (Hey)
Up on a tractor
[Chorus]
Tryna steer my daughters off the pole
And my sons out of jail (Sons out of jail)
Tryna get to church so I don't go to hell (I don't wanna go)
I'm just tryna keep my wife (Hey babe) from figuring out (I love you)
That I married up (So fine girl) and she married way way down
In Alabama where they love Nick Saban (Roll tide)
Tryna write a song the local country station will play
Hey, I'm just tryna stay out of AA (Ooh, ooh, come on, babe, right here)

[Bridge]
Tell you, ooh-ooh-ooh, tryna stay out of AA every day
One step at a time, yeah
Life's hard, family's weird
Sometimes you just need a beer
Can I get an Amen? (Amen)

[Chorus]
Man, I'm just tryna keep my daughters off the pole
And my sons out of jail (Sons out of jail)
Tryna get to church so I don't go to hell (I don't wanna go)
I'm just tryna keep my wife (Hey babe) from figuring out (I love you)
That I married up (So fine girl) and she married way way down
In Alabama where they love Nick Saban (Roll Tide)
Tryna write a song the local country station will play

More bounce to the ounce, pick it up, put it down (Woah)
Wanna put his sweet treat in my Fudge Round (Bow)
Tighter than ever, he ain't had it like this
Toes curling like they're throwing peace signs on grip (On grip)
One thing about me, I ain’t takin' no mess
He’s hooked, I know it's making his old flame stress
In control, I got his heart tamed (I got his heart tamed)
Tryna let a guy know who really run things (Huh, ah)

Papi, nos perdemo', nos parqueamo' y lo prendemo'
Pa' la seca algo bebemo', y cuando nos emborrachemo'
Una de reggaetón ponemo' y nos vamo' a donde nos podamos querer
Nos podamos comer (Eh-ah)

No sé si te convenza (Ey)
Nos damo' un rocecito por Provenza
Y si la cosa se pone tensa, en mi cama la recompensa
O viceversa, ¿por qué lo piensas? (¡No!)
Pasamo' por el barrio por hierba (Hierba)
Ponla en la hookah pa' que se disuelva
La química todavía se conserva
Y yo te lo hago rico para que vuelva'
Aunque mañana me voy, aprovéchame que aquí estoy
Puesta pa' ti, por eso te escribí

English,65,All I Want For Christmas Is You,person,Mariah Carey,All I Want For Christmas Is You by Mariah Carey,"[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus]
I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you

[Outro]
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (Ah, oh, ah, oh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I really want, baby, ooh)

You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfin' now
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now, mmm
Couldn't ever imagine even havin' doubts
But not everything works out, no

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Now I'm out dancin' with strangers
You could be casually datin'
Damn, it's all changin' so fast

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Así e' la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around and it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Así e' la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
It's been a hell of a year, thank God we made it out
Yeah, we were ridin' a wave and trying not to drown
And on the surface, I held it together
But underneath, I sorta came unwound
Where would I be? You're all that I need
My world, baby, you hold me down
You always hold me down

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran, Ed Sheeran & Camila Cabello]
Well, I've been the breaker and broken
Every mistake turned to moments
Wouldn't take anything back

[Intro]
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Eh-eh-eh-eh

[Pre-Coro]
No sé si es casualidad que yo me sienta así
Siempre que tú estás cerquita de mí
Dime qué me hiciste, qué droga me diste
Que desde aquella noche no soy igual
Tú me mira' y empiezo a sudar
Siento que puedo volar

[Coro]
Baby, la nota ya está haciendo efecto
Mi mundo está jodío' y me siento perfecto
Porque estás tú, aquí, moviéndote así, no pare'
Baby, tú eres mi droga, esta noche no le baje'
Porque la nota ya está haciendo efecto
Mi mundo está jodío' y me siento perfecto
Porque estás tú, aquí, moviéndote así, no pare'
Baby, tú eres mi droga, esta noche no le baje'

[Post-Coro]
Esta no, esta sí
Esta no, esta sí
Esta no, esta sí
Esta no, esta sí
[Verso]
El gatito tuyo te perdió por negligencia
Y yo que no creo en la abstinencia
Esta noche en la cama va a haber turbulencia'
Qué rico tú mama', te vo'a dar la permanencia'
Ese totito e' la eminencia
Pa' darle tengo licencia
Desde que fuimo' a Florencia
Se puso más bicha, pero no pierde la esencia
No, no, de Carola
No, no, no, no anda sola
No, no, no le diga' ""hola""
O va' a ser otro pa' la cola
Tu piquete me mola
Yo soy fan de esa popola (Mua, mua)
Más las picky, las endo, la coca y la rola (Más nada)
Eres tú quien me controla, eh (Jeje)

[Puente]
En tus ojo' veo el mar, mami, llévame en tu ola (Tú eres mala)
Hoy me siento bien puta, re piola, ey

[Coro]
Porque la nota ya está haciendo efecto
Mi mundo está jodío' y me siento perfecto
Porque estás tú, aquí, moviéndote así, no pare'

We've been swingin’ and missin'
It ain't broke yet, but damn, it needs fixin’
Been a while since your kiss felt like kissin'
It's just different

We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we been together
Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we’re better
Off with all this, but we’re caught in-between

A rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
That’s when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mеnds or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place

Throwin' in the towel takes some effort
So I’d rather ride it out for better weather
Together

English,71,Doin' This,person,Luke Combs,Doin' This by Luke Combs,"[Verse 1]
Someone asked me once in an interview
""What was growing up like?""
""Where'd you go to school?""
""And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?""
I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge
Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job, just makin' due
With tips in a jar, my guitar, and an old barstool

[Chorus]
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this

[Verse 2]
I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CD's just to give away
Payin' his dues
If I wasn't doin' this
Five deep in a van, head full of steam
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true
Livin' this life just like I was born to do
[Chorus]
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this

[Bridge]
It ain't about the fame
It ain't about the fortune
It ain't about the name
It ain't about the glory
I guess I'm sayin' it's always been about

[Chorus]
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this

I ain't got too much time to spare
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy, you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me comin' back even though I'm terrified

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight
[Verse 2]
I'm a fool, but they all think I'm blind
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind
I don't have to explain myself to you
I am a grown woman and I do what I want to do

But I want to have fun

I've been feelin' lonely
I need someone to hold me
Come on, baby, hold me
Yeah, I've been feelin' jaded
Don't know how I should play it
Tell me how to play it

[Pre-Chorus: Mae Muller]
Now you, you've been movin' on
Let me know, can I come along?
Since you're gone, oh, it's been so long
On my own, my own, my own, my own

[Chorus: Mae Muller]
Livin' in a haze, stayin' in the shade
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
I could use a break, can I get an ""amen""?
All I do is sit around and wait for better days

[Verse 2: Polo G]
Uh, uh
Can I get a ""amen""? Introverted, can't make friends
Pray for better days, now it's three hundred K when my day ends
Do you remember last night? 'Cause I blacked out
In that all white dress with her back out
Said be careful with her heart 'cause it's fragile
And thinkin' 'bout her past make her lash out
See, with me, it ain't no worries at all
Any problem, I'll be there, one call
If we locked in, you my dawg
Fan of you, I hang pictures on my wall
Roll one, let's get high tonight
Backseat, Maybach, lavish life
Chillin' with the stars like a satellite
AP on my arm and it's shinin' bright, uh
[Chorus: Mae Muller]
Livin' in a haze (Haze), stayin' in the shade (The shade)
All I do is sit around and wait for better days (Oh, I sit around and wait)
I could use a break, can I get an ""amen""? (Amen)
All I do is sit around and wait for better days

[Post-Chorus: Mae Muller]
Sit around, sit around, sit around and wait
For better, better, better days, oh
I could use a break, oh
Better, better, better, better
For better days, no, no

[Outro: Mae Muller]
Oh no, no, no
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
Better days
All I do is sit around and wait for better days, no, no",0,2022,"Rap

English,74,Meet Me At Our Spot,feat,THE ANXIETY: WILLOW & Tyler Cole,Meet Me At Our Spot by THE ANXIETY: WILLOW & Tyler Cole,"[Verse 1: WILLOW]
When I wake up, I can't even stay up
I slept through the day, fuck
I'm not getting younger
But when I'm older, I'll be so much stronger
I'll stay up for longer
Meet me at our spot

[Chorus: WILLOW]
Caught a vibe (Woo, woo)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
I just wanna look into your eyes (Your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna stay for the night, night, night
When we take a drive (Woo, woo)
Maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life

[Verse 2: Tyler Cole & WILLOW]
When I go to sleep, I can't even fall asleep
Something's got ahold of me
Feel it taking over me
But when I'm older I'll be moving onward
I just got a drunk text
(Meet me at our spot)
[Chorus: WILLOW & Tyler Cole]
We caught a vibe (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
When I look into your eyes (Your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna hold you all night (All night)
Maybe we can take a drive (Take a drive)
Baby, we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life

[Bridge: WILLOW]
Meet me at our spot
Got something I wanna show you
Meet me at our spot
They can't find us there
Meet me at our spot
Got something I wanna show you
Meet me at our spot
They can't find us there

[Chorus: WILLOW & Tyler Cole]
Caught a vibe (Woo, woo)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
I just wanna look into your eyes (Into your eyes)

English,75,Fingers Crossed,person,Lauren Spencer Smith,Fingers Crossed by Lauren Spencer Smith,"[Verse 1]
Introduced me to your family
Watched my favorite shows on your TV
Made me breakfast in the mornin'
When you got home from work

[Verse 2]
Makin' plans to travel 'round the world
Said we'd always put each other first
Old love songs we used to play to
Funny, now I hate you

[Chorus]
Now, I
Remember when you'd call me late at night
I gave you my hours and advice just tryna fix you
And all your daddy issues
But now, I don't even miss you anymore
So, I
I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent givin' advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
When you said you loved me
Well, you must've had your fingers crossed

[Verse 3]
Shoulda paid attention to my friends
Tellin' me how bad it's gonna end
Always givin' their opinions
Now I wish I would have listened
[Pre-Chorus]
I could say I'm sorry, but I'm not
You don't deserve the one thing that you lost

[Chorus]
Now, I
Remember when you'd call me late at night
And I gave you my hours and advice just tryna fix you
And all your daddy issues
But now, I don't even miss you anymore
So, I
I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent givin' advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
When you said you loved me
Well, you must've had your fingers crossed

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Your fingers crossed
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Your fingers crossed
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Oh, when you said you loved me
Well, you must've had your fingers crossed

[Outro]
Oh, I
I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent giving advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
Wish you said you loved me

English,76,All Too Well (Taylor's Version),person,Taylor Swift,All Too Well (Taylor's Version) by Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
[Verse 4]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well",0,2022,"Rock

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly""

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancin' merrily
In the new old-fashioned way

English,81,Broadway Girls,feat,Lil Durk Featuring Morgan Wallen,Broadway Girls by Lil Durk Featuring Morgan Wallen,"[Intro: Morgan Wallen & Lil Durk]
2 AM at a Broadway bar
She's puttin’ her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don’t mean
And you know

[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
I met her down at Aldean's
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Lil Durk]
Oh, there’s two things that you’re gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I’da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
Them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave ’em alone)
Leave them Broadway girls alone

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
They town just told me, ""Don't trust 'em""
Broadway girls a trap
They on me, they tryna finesse me
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
I can't run out of money
The trenches love me forever
They treat me like Ed in London
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars
[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Them Broadway girls alone

[Bridge: Morgan Wallen & Lil Durk]
Oh, think I oughta settle down
And find me somethin' I can take back to my hometown, oh
But I told 'em that I'm savage
They just tryna tell me there's

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
There's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Leave them Broadway girls alone

Banger
Oh yeah, I'm finna make a banger with this one

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Last time you told me you proud of me, you wasn't proud of me, you was the nigga who doubted me
I was too mad at you, you let 'em come kill you, my brother, that shit was a tragedy
But magically, I got the strategy, I was so sick and tired of niggas keep asking me
""Who was the killers between the hood?"" (DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)
Bro, I'm a king, that mean we good
Talked to my tete about my problems
Learned to survive, I carry my chopper
Before I was twelve, I went to the doctor
Fucked on a stripper and I took me a Roxy
How you my blood and you say you gon' pop me?
Fall over loyalty, never 'bout thotties
Don't mention my name if you mentionin' bodies
Don't mention my name if you mentionin' bodies
Stopped taking drugs, had to sit in a sauna
How you gon' blame me? I gave her Gabbana
Bitch, I'm a star, gotta use condom
Don't drink Par, only like Wocka
Sippin' on Wocka, I feel like I'm Flocka
Shit in my pocket, that shit'll go blocka
Say that I'm mean, what you mean? I caught you
Get away from her, high speed, no tossin'
Called you a bitch, I'm sorry I lost you
Head down, X pill, Percocet, off it
Bitch, my phone died, pass me a charger
Ain't have a coat, walked to school in a thermal
Bitches you lookin' up to, they'll burn you
Get out my business, that shit don't concern you
I get to diggin' this shit when I learn you
I love the trenches, this shit is eternal
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
I wish my brother had made it out surgery
I be up thinkin', that shit do be hurtin' me
If they gon' catch me, them niggas gon' murder me (Oh no, oh)
Gave my bro twenty, he caught for a burglary
I love the bitches who say they ain't heard of me
Ever seen blood? That shit'll turn burgundy
[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Fresh like the first day of school, I'm a scholar
Found the solution and got some more problems
We from the sandbox, my dawg since a toddler
Sixteen years old when I shot my first chopper
Flew out of Van Nuys, landed in Opa-locka
Quit flyin' in G5, fly helicopters (Fly helicopters)
I count every blessin', they count every dollar
I'm 'bout to go factory plain
I treat all of my dawgs the same
Take care all of my bitches the same
I just hope you financially sane
Never turning my back on the gang
From the A, we was taught to be brave
Had to squabble and take a few fades
Stay rock solid, you'll get through the phase
Damn my nigga, what happened to Virgil?
Talked to God, I don't wanna get murdered
I got style, I don't know what you heard of
You lil' pussy, you soft and fertile
Only real ones throughout my circle
Only real ones throughout my circle, oh
R.I.P. Prince, I'ma pour up some purple
600 Maybach, the one with the curtain
Young GunnaWunna, the boy bought the Birkin
I'm goin' hard, know you proud of me workin'
Ridin' round the town sippin' and swervin'
Hold it down, do this shit with a purpose
Louis down, man, this shit came from Virgil
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?","[Intro: King Von]
Oh yeah, I'm about to make a hit with this one

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Last time you told me you were proud of me, you weren't really proud, you were the one who doubted me
I was so upset with you, you let them come after you, my brother, that was a tragedy
But eventually, I found a way, I was tired of people asking me
""Who were the culprits in the neighborhood?""
Bro, I'm a king, that means we're good
I talked to my mentor about my problems
Learned to survive, I keep my weapon
Before I was twelve, I went to the doctor
Had a night out and took a pill
How can you be my family and say you'll betray me?
Loyalty first, never about others
Don't mention my name if you're talking about conflicts
Don't mention my name if you're talking about conflicts
Stopped taking drugs, had to relax
How can you blame me? I gave her luxury
I'm a star, gotta use protection
Don’t drink Par, only like Wocka
Sipping on Wocka, I feel like I'm unstoppable
Money in my pocket, that’s valuable
Said I'm tough, what do you mean? I caught you
Stay away from her, high speed, no stopping
Called you out, sorry I lost you
Head down, taking pills, off it
Phone died, pass me a charger
Didn't have a coat, walked to school in a thermal
People you look up to might let you down
Stay out of my business, that’s not your concern
I get to learning when I dig in
I love the struggle, this life is eternal
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
I wish my brother had made it out of surgery
I stay up thinking, it really hurts me
If they catch me, they’ll harm me
Gave my bro twenty, he’s in for a robbery
I appreciate the people who say they don’t know me
Ever seen blood? It turns dark red

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Fresh like the first day of school, I'm a scholar
Found the solution and encountered more problems
We came from the same place, my buddy since we were young
Sixteen years old when I first used a chopper
Flew out of Van Nuys, landed in Opa-locka
Stopped flying in G5s, now I fly helicopters
I count every blessing, they count every dollar
I’m about to get a plain factory
I treat all my friends the same
Take care of all my people the same
I hope you're financially stable
Never turning my back on the crew
From Atlanta, we were taught to be brave
Had to fight and face challenges
Stay strong, you'll get through it
Damn, my friend, what happened to Virgil?
Talked to God, I don’t want to be hurt
I have style, not sure what you heard
You’re soft and vulnerable
Only real ones in my circle
Only real ones in my circle, oh
R.I.P. Prince, I’m pouring up some purple
600 Maybach, with the curtains
Young GunnaWunna, bought a Birkin
I’m going hard, know you’re proud of my work
Riding around the town, sipping and swerving
Holding it down, doing this with purpose
Louis down, this came from Virgil
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?

She finna tell me ""No way"" and it's cap
Nigga, can't even see me, I'm way in the sky
G5 the flight, nigga way in the sky
G5 the flight, man, I'm way outta here

[Chorus]
G5 the flight, nigga, can't even see me
I'm way outta here, I'm too far in the sky
Hermès ashtray to dump my ashes
Bitch so pretty, look better than Cassie
Puffin' on zooties and she callin' me daddy
Walkin' on shit, turn it up and I gas it
Came out the gutter, it ain't nothin' for me to swag it
Secure the bag, got a bitch, I'ma bag it
Turnin' it up, gotta make sure shit good
Park it, two mil' in the middle of my hood
Drinkin' on mud, I made it out of thе sewer
Chrome Hеart accessories, whatever, I'm good
Lot of these niggas, they lookin' the same
They copy my lingo, they bitin' my chain
Championship, championship, Range just gon' amp this shit
Bitch break her neck just to look at the kid

[Verse 1]
Dirty the Fanta but make it in Canada
Bro get this money like it's my religion
It's gon' be a mad day, a sad day for any of these niggas
That try to compare whatever I did
Damn near touched a hundred, it just off the gig
I came out the jungle, they kidnapped a kid
I trap out a bando, spent ten on a crib
I look at the ocean to spot thirty M's
Pin it where I'm at, the city I'm in
I give you my fully, no matter where I'm in
Her hair touch her ass, she gon' think she Korean
You fuckin' me good, bitch, you helpin' me win
Niggas can't see me, ain't no competition
Too many bracelets, need a whole 'nother wrist
I'm never sober, don't think I'ma quit
I pop the E, I can feel when it kick

They copy my lingo, they bitin' my chain
Championship, championship, Range just gon' amp this shit
Bitch break her neck just to look at the kid

[Verse 2]
Count up some millions then take some more drugs
Been stuck in my memory, they wasn't showing love
Ain't matching my fly, bitch, you know you a dub
I started this wave and ain't using a brush
Stopped taking molly, I'm back on the E
Flying commercial, you ain't high as me
Driving a spaceship, the one with the wings
Cross up the trap, I done broke down a key
Ain't let no fuck nigga holdin' me back
Put a switch on it, these lil' niggas whack
After I hit your bitch, givin' her back
Ain't got no roof, put her heart on a strap
Go to the moon, ain't gon' show you no slatt
Pluto tycoon, ain't no regular 'Cat
Took a few shrooms, I forget where I'm at
Poppin' a Tesla, I feel when it kick

G5 the flight, can't even see me
I'm way outta here, too far in the sky
Hermès ashtray for my ashes
She’s so pretty, she’s better than Cassie
Chillin' and relaxin', she calls me daddy
Walking on air, turning up, and I’m gassing
Came from humble beginnings, no problem to swag it
Secured the bag, got it all, and I’m bragging
Turning it up, making sure everything's good
Parked it, two mil' in the middle of my hood
Sipping on something, made it out of tough times
Chrome Heart accessories, everything's fine
Lot of these folks, they look the same
They copy my style, they’re imitating my name
Championship vibes, this ride's amping
She breaks her neck just to see me

[Verse 1]
Cleaned up the Fanta, made it in Canada
Bro gets this money like it’s my religion
It’s gonna be a tough day for anyone
Who tries to compare what I’ve done
Damn near touched a hundred, just off my grind
Came from the struggle, faced many tough times
I invest in property, spent on my home
Looking at my progress, thirty million to my name
Pinpoint my location, wherever I roam
I give you my all, no matter where I’m at
Her hair touches her back, she thinks she's royalty
You treat me well, you’re helping me succeed
People can’t see me, there’s no competition
Too many bracelets, need another wrist
I’m never sober, don’t think I’ll quit
I take a pill, feel the effects of it

G5 the flight, can't even see me
I'm way outta here, too far in the sky

[Verse 2]
Counting up some earnings, then taking it easy
Stuck in my memory, they weren’t showing love
Ain’t matching my style, you know you’re a miss
I started this wave without any brush
Stopped taking heavy stuff, back to feeling free
Flying regular, not as high as me
Driving a cool ride, the one with the wings
Crossing up the trap, I’ve broken down the key
Won’t let anyone hold me back
Made it efficient, others fall flat
After I’m done, I’ll give her back
No roof, put her heart on a strap
Heading to the moon, won’t show any slack
Pluto tycoon, no regular ‘Cat
Took a few shrooms, forget where I'm at
Driving my Tesla, feeling the kick

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun

Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square

To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Jingle around the clock

[Verso 1: Li Saumet]
Hace mucho tiempo le hago caso al corazón
Y pasan los día', los mese’ pensando en tu olor (En tu olor, en tu olor)
Ha llegado el tiempo para usar la razón
Ante' que sea tarde y sin querer me parta en do' (Parta en do’)

[Pre-Coro: Li Saumet]
Ante' de que salga el sol, hunde el acelerador
Aunque vaya sin freno' y pierda el control
Nada má' seremos do', tú y yo acariciándono'
En medio del tiempo, sin decir adió'

[Coro: Li Saumet]
Y solo mírame (Mírame) con esos ojito' lindo’ (Lindo’)
Que con еso yo estoy bien (-toy bien), hoy hе vuelto a nacer (Nacer)

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny]
Hace tiempo (Tiempo) que no agarro a nadie de la mano (Mano)
Hace tiempo (Tiempo) que no envío ""Buenos días, te amo"" (Te amo)
Pero, tú me tiene' enreda’o (Enreda'o), me envolví (Envolví)
Iba por mi camino y me perdí (Ey, ey)
Mi mirada cambió cuando tus ojos vi (Tus ojos vi)
Bye-bye a los culo', ni me despedí
Yo no te busqué (-qué), no (No), chocamo' en el trayecto
Con tu alma es la que yo conecto (-necto)
Tranquila, no tiene que ser perfecto, no
Aquí no existe el pecado (-cado) y equivocarse es bonito
Los errore’ son placere' (-cere'), igual que to' tus besito'
[Coro: Li Saumet, Bad Bunny & Li Saumet]
Y solo mírame (Mírame) con esos ojito' lindo' (Lindo')
Que con eso yo estoy bien (-toy bien), hoy he vuelto a nacer (Nacer)
Y solo mírame (Mírame) con esos ojito' lindo' (Lindo')
Que con eso yo estoy bien (-toy bien), hoy he vuelto a nacer (Nacer)

[Interludio: Li Saumet & Bad Bunny]
Tú y yo, tú y yo, tú y yo
Tú y yo, tú y yo
Tú y yo, tú y yo, tú y yo
Tú y yo, tú y yo
Tú y yo, tú y yo
Tú y yo, tú y yo

[Verso 3: Bad Bunny]
Yo no me dejo llevar de nadie
Yo solo me dejo llevar de tu sonrisa (-risa)
Y del lunar cerquita de tu boca (Boca)
Si yo estoy loco, tú estás loquita (-quita)
Pero, baby, como tú no hay otra, no (No)
Quiero regalarte girasole' (-sole')
Ir pa' la playa y buscarte caracole'
Cuando estoy contigo, yo no miro el Role' (Role')
Vamo' a bailar doscientas cancione' (-cione')
Nadie me pone como tú me pone' (Pone')
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Yo le hablo a Dio' y tú ere' su respuesta
Aprendí que los momento' lindo' nunca cuestan
Como cuando me regalas tu mirada
Y el sol su puesta, y el sol su puesta
Ey, ey, cuando estoy encima de ti, de ti
Mami, yo me olvido de to', de to'
No hace falta nadie aquí
Solamente tú y yo

Don't let anybody tell ya it's gonna be easy

[Chorus]
And that's the trouble with a heartbreak, it's gonna hang around

Yeah, that's the trouble with a heartbreak, a heartbreak, yeah

Girl, I still think about us
[Chorus]
And that's the trouble with a heartbreak, it's gonna hang around
Leave you midnight breakin' down, wonderin' how
Long that it's gonna take gettin' over her

And always just say goodnight (La-la-la-la-la-la)
And we cuddle, sure, I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, oh-oh

Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you groove, oh-oh

I, I feel like fuckin' somethin'
But we could be corny, fuck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy, dummy
I likе to say, ""What if?"" But if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, give me two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh

Push the limit, no, you ain't good enough
All your niggas say that you lost without me
All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga (Feel like jail)
I can't even exhale, nigga (Exhale)
Pussy like holy grail, you know that (Holy grail)
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half, man, lyin' on your ****, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this ass for real (All this ass)
Drama make you feel (Make you feel)
Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you

I, I feel like doing something
But we could just be casual, it’s fine
Sugar, I’m no fool, not at all
I like to dream, but if
We could talk and just get to the point
Then I might be into something
I’m not giving you just a little
I’m giving you a lot, why not?
Something we just gotta get into

Everyone wishes for a special booth

I told my mama, I told my friends
When it comes to her, when it comes to him, never again
Last time was the last time, that time nearly did us in
Yeah, too much drama
Girl, you're a match, you're gasoline, we just burn too fast
So here we are, lightin' up that spark
Yeah, we tried to run, but we didn't get far

[Chorus: Cole Swindell & Lainey Wilson]
I never say never with you, I end up together with you
It's hell and it's heaven with you, baby
Anything's possible, the highs are unstoppable
It's so uncontrollable, it's crazy
We say we won't and then we do
You're all I want, I never say never with you

[Verse 2: Cole Swindell, Lainey Wilson, Cole Swindell & Lainey Wilson]
You got a touch that kills me, makes me feel alive
Couldn't turn me off, yeah, even if you tried
So keep turnin' me on and turn out the lights
Who knows? Tonight, we might get it right

[Chorus: Cole Swindell & Lainey Wilson, Lainey Wilson]
I never say never with you, I end up together with you
It's hell and it's heaven with you, baby
Anything's possible, the highs are unstoppable
It's so uncontrollable, it's crazy
We say we won't and then we do
You're all I want, I never say never with you, yeah
I never say never with you
[Chorus: Cole Swindell, Lainey Wilson, Cole Swindell & Lainey Wilson]
I never say never with you, I end up together with you
It's hell and it's heaven with you, baby
Anything's possible, the highs are unstoppable
It's so uncontrollable, it's crazy
We say we won't and then we do
You're all I want, I never say never with you
We say we won't, but what's the use?
Baby, come on, I'll never say never with you
Oh, no
You're all I want, I'll never say never with you
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

English,93,Damn Strait,person,Scotty McCreery,Damn Strait by Scotty McCreery,"[Verse 1]
Nobody In His Right Mind Would've Left Her
That was her favorite song
She sang along every time it came on
The first time we danced was to Marina Del Rey
And I fell right there and then
I didn't want that song to end
Baby Blue was the color of her eyes
I can still see them in my mind
Probably will for the rest of my life

[Chorus]
Damn strait, you're killing me, man
You know I've always been your biggest fan
Now I can't even listen
'Cause I'll get to missin' her
Then the hurt gets worse
Damn strait, I used to love your songs
But now every time that one comes on
My heart gets broke in half
But do I wish I could get her back?
Damn straight

[Verse 2]
The other day right out of the Blue Clear Sky
You came on in my truck
I couldn't turn it off fast enough
I tried to get back in the game
But this ole heart just ain't the same
Hell, I can't even Give It Away
[Chorus]
Damn strait, you're killing me, man
You know I've always been your biggest fan
Now I can't even listen
'Cause I'll get to missin’ her
Then the hurt gets worse
Damn strait, I used to love your songs
But now every time that one comes on
My heart gets broke in half
But do I wish I could get her back?
Damn straight

[Bridge]
I know it ain't your fault
That she left me
And you know you'll always be the king
But right now I Hate Everything

[Chorus]
Damn strait, you're killing me, man
You know I've always been your biggest fan
Now I can't even listen
'Cause I’ll get to missin' her
Then the hurt gets worse
Damn strait, I used to love your songs
But now every time that one comes on
My heart gets broke in half
But do I wish I could get her back?
Damn straight

[Verse 1]
You want the girl with the small waist
And the perfect smile
Someone who's out every weekday
In her dad's new car
You tell me I shouldn't stress out
Say, ""It's not that hard""
But I just got a feeling
This will leave an ugly scar

[Pre-Chorus]
If you say, ""She's nothing to worry about""
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?

[Chorus]
Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind
One day wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't havе
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad
Shе's got everything that I don't have, hm-mm
[Verse 2]
You want someone you can show off
Whenever you go out
She'll wear a tight mini black dress
With all her friends around
And then you'll probably spend the night at
Her nice big house
And by then I'll just be someone
You've forgotten about, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
If you say, ""She's nothing to worry about""
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?

Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind
One day wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't have
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad
She's got everything that I don't have
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be
[Post-Chorus]
She's all I wanna be so bad, oh-ooh

Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you would hurt this bad
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?

Yeah, this could be your last first kiss, if we do this thing right
Your last time alone beneath neon lights

It's a beautiful day, she's been cryin' all night
Aw, there's tears in her blues, bloodshot in mine
This bender's been bendin', it's hell-bound to break
My baby's had all she can take

[Chorus: ERNEST]
Mister, I'll take your roses
If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more
I'll buy violets and daisies to hide all the crazy
It's gonna take all you've got
Aw, it's a bad day for love
But a good day for flower shops

[Verse 2: Morgan Wallen]
Well, I took some pills and she took the dogs
Aw, it's all gone to hell, she's gone to her mom's
And I took up drinkin' since she took the time
To tell me I took the best years of her life

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
So, buddy, I'll take your roses
If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more
I'll buy violets and daisies to hide all the crazy
It's gonna take all you've got
Yeah, it's a tough day for love
But a good day for flower shops

You and I
Had this off and on so long
You've been here, then you've been gone
So many times
And every night
Yeah, I'm always bumpin' into you
We do the same things we used to
It's your place or it's mine, so

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown

[Chorus]
One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey
Are you on your way?
Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'
We'll be on our way
So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever

[Verse 2]
Mm, every time I'm at this bar, tap on the shoulder, turn around
And baby, there you are
And it's fire, you're like this Bourbon, hundred proof
Yeah, they don't burn the way you do
Yeah, we're better in the dark, so
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown

One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey
Are you on your way?
Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'
We'll be on our way
So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever

[Guitar Solo / Instrumental Break]
Hey

[Bridge]
Kinda like that Georgia wind
We'll be gone and back again
But always wind up right back where we are
Playin' roulette with our hearts
And blowin' smoke rings in the dark, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown

Are you on your way?

English,100,Circles Around This Town,person,Maren Morris,Circles Around This Town by Maren Morris,"[Verse 1]
I swear I don't know how I trusted
A Montero with the AC busted
A couple bad demos on a burned CD
Would take me all the way to Tennessee
I showed up to the new apartment
First month's, last month's, two deposits
Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet
Thank God I was an optimist

[Chorus]
I drove circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town
Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, I got here, but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this town

[Verse 2]
So many times, I thought about lеavin'
Got my ass kicked tryin' to compete with
Evеrybody else's ones that got away
Hung around long enough to catch a break
A couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked
Was the one about a car and the one about a church
That I wrote
[Chorus]
Drivin' circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town
Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, I got here, but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this town
Drivin' circles around this town
Hey

I drove circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town

Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
I still get lost, I still get found

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)

Standing right outside my door

A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

[Pre-Chorus]
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

[Verse 2]
How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

[Bridge]
I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this rollercoaster

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Astronaut

[Chorus]
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean

[Verse 1]
She say that I'm cool (Damn straight)
I'm like, ""Yeah, that's true"" (That's true)
I believe in G-O-D (Ayy)
Don't believe in T-H-O-T
She keep playing me dumb, uh (Play me)
I'ma play her for fun (Uh-huh)
Y'all don't really know my mental
Let me give you the picture like stencil
Fallin' out in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pourin' down (Pourin' down)
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn't know which, which way to turn
Flow was cool, but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge (Ayy)
[Bridge]
Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work (Yuh)
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (Uh, get it)
Everything that I do is electric (Ayy)
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it movin' like kinetic, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, li-li-li-li-like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (Now let me pray), uh
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimmin' in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh (Ayy)
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine (Spine)
They say that I'm so fine (Fine)
You could never match my grind (True)
Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf)

[Chorus]
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

[Verse 2]
Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
We took the long way 'round
And burned till the fun ran out, now
[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

I get up, I get down
And I'm jumpin' around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang! Bang! Bang!
So I got an apartment across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge
Still, I'm not feeling grown
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to go
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Here we go!)

[Chorus]
So put your best face on everybody
Pretend you know this song everybody
Come hang (Come hang)
Let's go out with a bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try so whatever
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!
[Verse 2]
Feel like I'm gonna puke
'Cause my taxes are due
Do my password begin with a one or a two?
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Metronome!)
Man, I'm up to somethin' (Up to somethin')
Oo-dee-la-dee-doe
Thank you all for comin' (All for comin')
I hope you like the show
'Cause it's on a budget (On a budget)
So ooh-dee-la-dee-doe
Yeah, come on here we go
Yeah, come on (Here we go!)

So put your best face on everybody
Pretend you know this song everybody

Bur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs off
Tried to get away from me, had a standoff
Hit him in the spine, knock his dreads off
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Thuggin' in my Reeboks, ridin' with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
OG made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box

[Verse 1: SpotemGottem]
In Miami with my motherfuckin' heat out
With another nigga bitch, said she got her feet out
I walked in the party, I'm on my big goon shit
Ready to get it started, bitch, I got no sensе
Oh, he the plug, ridin' 'round with four bricks
Call me Kobе, twenty-four on me
Can't fuck wit' her no more, that lil' bitch, she do the most
I get my groove on every time I see them folks
I got the antidote, I'm thinking that's something you need to know
I'm smooth and I'm cold, she know my wrist on froze
Skinny jeans on with a big bankroll
She playin' my song, I got her takin' off her thong
I'm tryna get it on, she feeling all over my Peter bone
Two rights don't make a wrong, it just go on and on
I'm kickin' shit like Jackie Chan 'til they got my kicks on
I aim, I hit my target, I'ma up this bitch regardless

I'm strapped up wit' this jug, one in the head, already de-cocked (It's de-cocked)
I pop out when the beef hot, won't see me creepin' on your block (Nope, nope)
I work the back seat, we went three deep and got ten people shot (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
I hit the auto-switch and made it twerk and while he dumped the Glock (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
Got the drop on all his spot, he gettin' robbed if he go or not
I know the taste and love Wock', he pourin' up in exotic pop
That booster hitter tried to pull a move and that shit got him dropped
Blrrrd, blrrrd-blrrrd, you pussies know what's up
Turn a nigga to a pack, we break 'em down and roll 'em up
Ain't shit changed but the whip, now it's a Rolls truck when I'm pulling up
And I still ain't check the time up on my Cartier, just hold it up (Blrrrd)
Don't come around acting gangster, we call your bluff (Blrrrd-blrrrd)
Put trust in these firearms, know we dangerous

In Miami with the heat out
With another girl, she said she’s got her feet out
I walked in the party, on my big moves
Ready to get it started, you know I got no sense
Oh, he’s the plug, ridin' 'round with four bricks
Call me Kobe, twenty-four on me
Can’t mess with her no more, she’s doin' the most
I get my groove on every time I see them
I got the antidote, something you need to know
I’m smooth and cold, you know my wrist is froze
Skinny jeans on, big bankroll
She’s playin' my song, now she’s takin' off her clothes
I’m tryna get it on, she’s feelin' all over me

I’m strapped up with this tool, ready and locked
I pop out when the heat’s up, you won't see me on your block
I work from the back seat, three deep, ten shots fired
Switched it to auto, made it jump while he emptied the Glock
Got the drop on all his spots, getting robbed, no matter what
I know the taste, pourin' up, it’s exotic stuff
Someone tried to make a move, but it got him stopped
Blrrrd, blrrrd, they know what’s up
Turn someone into a pack, break it down, roll it up
The ride’s changed, now it's a Rolls truck when I pull up
Still haven’t checked the time on my Cartier, just hold it up (Blrrrd)
Don’t come around acting tough, we call that bluff (Blrrrd-blrrrd)
We put trust in these arms, we’re dangerous
If you catch me speeding, better give it up or I’ll let loose
We shoot your stuff up on the highway, stay out of our lane

English,34,Beautiful Mistakes,feat,Maroon 5 Featuring Megan Thee Stallion,Beautiful Mistakes by Maroon 5 Featuring Megan Thee Stallion,"[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day, you'll come back to me

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back
I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes

[Verse 3: Megan Thee Stallion]
You did me wrong 'cause I let you (Let you)
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doin' something different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you dreaming, lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

[Bridge: Megan Thee Stallion]
Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)
Now you're stressin' out, pulling your hair (Hair)
Smelling your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (Sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)
You're toxic
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, yeah, yeah (Oh)
Makin' beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh

English,66,Beggin',band,Maneskin,Beggin' by Maneskin,"[Intro]
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'

[Chorus]
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

[Verse 1]
Riding high when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you won me then
But easy come and easy go and it would end

[Verse 2]
So anytime I bleed, you let me go
Yah, anytime I feed, you get me, no
Anytime I seek, you let me know
But I plant and seed, just let me go
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey, yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta!

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
Uh, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you, ah
And put your loving hand out, darlin'
[Verse 3]
I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

[Verse 4]
An empty shell, I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

[Verse 5]
What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it away, you had it and you took the pay
But I keep walkin' on, keep openin' doors
Keep hopin' for, now the door is yours
Keep also home
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'
[Chorus]
Mmm, yeah, yeah, I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

[Bridge]
I'm fighting hard to hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
I'm just a calm, 'bout to fade to black

[Chorus]
I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Got her own money, she don't need no nig'
On the dance floor, she had two, three drinks
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in
That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Drive her own car (Alright), she don't need no Lyft
In the strip club (Oh yeah), know my girl gon' tip
Now she twerkin' (Huh), she throw it out and come back in (Ha)

[Verse 1: Saweetie]
Beep-beep, is that my bestie in a Tessie?
Fresh blow out, skin on ten, ooh, she ready
Bitch, you look goodt, with a T at the end
I'ma hype her every time, that my mothеrfuckin' friend
She been down since thе jellies and the bobos
Now we steppin' out the G in Manolos
When we pull up to the scene, they be filled with jealousy
If a bitch get finicky, she gon' bring that energy (Pop-pop-pop)
I hit her phone with the tea, like, ""Bitch, guess what?
All the rich-ass boys wanna fuck on us""
All this ass sittin' up, you could look, don't touch
And I'm bad bussin' bands every time we link up

That's my best friend, if you need a freak
I ain't dumb, but motherfucker, she my Tweedledee
If she ride for me (Ride), she don't need a key
If you sideways, she'll straighten you if needed be
And she so bad that I just can't take that bitch nowhere
She off her fifth shot, said, ""Mm-mm, don't go there""
Bitch, break her back, she protect and attack
Get that strap like them buckle, foot on neck, give no air
Whole world wanna be us
And my main bitch, she my day-one
On my way, bitch, let you get drunk
And celebrate 'cause we the baddest in the club

A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

[Verse 2]
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
[Bridge]
Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name

[Chorus]
Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer

Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

[Bridge]
I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

English,61,Chasing After You,feat,Ryan Hurd With Maren Morris,Chasing After You by Ryan Hurd With Maren Morris,"[Verse 1: Ryan Hurd]
You come over when your wine's all gone
Always catch me when I'm not that strong
Then you wind up staying all night long
Ain't nothin' new
Then I wake up with you on my chest
You got a way of making me forget
Girl, with you the answer's always yes
Every time you call

[Chorus: Ryan Hurd & Maren Morris]
But I know, yeah I know it's a matter of time
'Till you walk, 'till you walk back out of my life
Leave me standing here lonely feeling like a fool
Every time, every time you say we're done
You come back to the love you werе running from
Don't know why, don't know why I let you but I do
Guess I love chasing aftеr you

[Verse 2: Maren Morris]
Listen
Wish I could quit you but it feels too good
If I could turn it off, you know I would
But somethin' 'bout you makes me think we could
Make it after all
[Chorus: Ryan Hurd & Maren Morris]
But I know, yeah I know it's a matter of time
'Till you walk, 'till you walk back out of my life
Leave me standing here lonely feeling like a fool
Every time, every time you say we're done
You come back to the love you were running from
Don't know why, don't know why I let you but I do
Guess I love chasing after you

[Bridge: Ryan Hurd]
You come over when your wine's all gone
Always catch me when I'm not that strong
Then you wind up staying all night long
Ain't nothin' new

[Chorus: Ryan Hurd & Maren Morris]
But I know, yeah I know it's a matter of time
'Till you walk, 'till you walk back out of my life
Leave me standing here lonely feeling like a fool
Yeah, every time, every time you say we're done
You come back to the love you were running from
Don't know why, don't know why I let you but I do
Guess I love chasing after you

Real hot girl shit

[Chorus: DaBaby]
That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby
Her friends and mom hate me (Go)
Lay down on the bed, do the crybaby (Mmm)
She ain't gave me none of that pussy in a while
She had the boy waitin', I don't mind waitin' (Come here)
Oh, you ain't gon' respond to my texts? (Oh, yeah?)
Want me keep on my diamonds, we sex? (What's your name?)

[Verse 1: DaBaby]
Keisha? (Kei), Jasmine? (Jas), Kiera? Megan? (Go)
Lisa? Ashley? (Ashley), Sierra? Sarah?
She got her hands on her knees with her ass in the air, ooh, that lil' bitch a player
If her friends ain't around to record it, she bend over, shake that lil' ass in the mirror
Like goddamn, what a nigga gotta do for your number?
Shawty came through with that head so good, I said fuck it, I ain't usin' no rubber
Way she make that ass bounce, think I love her
Got that ass and that mouth from her mother
Type to make your bae mad, you in trouble
NBA playoffs that ass, it's a bubble
Uh-uh, uh-uh, come here, come here, uh-uh
Throw that ass back, come here, come here

Damn, he probably wanna wear my hoodie (Ah)
Choke me, spank me, look at me, thank me (Thank me)
If I give it to another nigga, he'll hate me (He'll hate me)
Spit, slurp, give him that work
Fell too fast for me, now the nigga hurt
Deeper, deeper, I need a reaper
Thought I was in trouble how he tearin' them cheeks up
Keep me a freak, who the flavor of the week?
If I make up the rules, then I don't think it's cheatin'
Jordan, Tommy, Timothy, Daniel (Which one?)
Might let Jonathan bring in Sarah (Come here, Sarah)
Bitch tryna brag about taking my man (Huh?)
Hah, I needed me a nigga off my hands (Hahahaha)
Uh-uh, don't fuck me like that, fuck me like this, yeah, ayy

His friends and his dad hate me (Yeah)

English,13,Deja Vu,person,Olivia Rodrigo,Deja Vu by Olivia Rodrigo,"[Verse 1]
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

[Verse 2]
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)
[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?

[Bridge]
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

Firewood crackle in the fall air
""Red Dirt"" playing on a radio
Big Dipper hanging high up there
Breathe in the Backwoods and let it go

[Pre-Chorus: Chase Rice]
I ain't ever been the church goin' type
Can't quote much past 3:16
Even though it's a Friday night
Church found me

[Chorus: Chase Rice]
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen
Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends
When the world's gone crazy, man, it all makes sense
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen, amen

[Post-Chorus: Chase Rice & Tyler Hubbard]
Tell em' boys
Yeah, baby

[Verse 2: Tyler Hubbard, with Brian Kelley]
Gotta thank him for a little piece of dirt
Little peace of mind from a cold one
Got a country angel I don't deserve
The kind that you never let go of
[Pre-Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Tyler Hubbard]
I don't know what Heaven looks like
No, I don't think anybody does
If it's like down here up there tonight
And there's folks like us

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Brian Kelley]
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, Amen (Talkin' God, amen)
Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends (With some downhome friends)
When the world's gone crazy, man, it all makes sense
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen, amen (Talkin' God, amen)
(Talkin' God, amen)

[Bridge: Chase Rice]
I don't know what Heaven looks like
And who the hell does?
If it's like down here up there tonight
There's folks like us

[Chorus: All, Tyler Hubbard & Brian Kelley & Chase Rice]
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, Amen
Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, Amen (Talkin' God, amen)
Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends (With some downhome friends)

English,8,Drivers License,person,Olivia Rodrigo,Drivers License by Olivia Rodrigo,"[Verse 1]
I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

[Verse 2]
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 3]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Bridge]
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 1: Lil Baby & Lil Durk]
Scratched a million off my checklist three years ago
Add two zeros to the one, I'm in a different mode
This my life, do what I want, I be with different hoes
You know the pick and roll, I picked her up and sent her home
I got rich off strong, we get ’em in and get 'em gone
You know Trappy just got out, I ain't have to put him on
We the ones who got the numbers, who put the city on
It’s the middle of the summer, I got a hoodie on
My demon time ain't nothin' nice
I try not to wear nothin' twice
I came up off of shootin' dice, yeah
My lil' brother ain't livin' right
My sis’ and ’em doin' aight
My cuz and ’em still servin' life, yeah
Seen a robber rob a deacon
I seen a preacher get caught for cheatin'
I'll break the bank for one of my people
I said, ""I’m the one,"" they didn't believe me
I show 'em the facts, now they all need me
I'ma get cake as long as I'm breathin'
They makin' it hard, this shit really easy, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist
All these hoes fuck on us all, I wish I would claim that bitch
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks
Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that bitch
You can miss me with that shit, you know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)
You know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby, DJ Khaled & Lil Durk]
Yeah, she think I'm a regular rapper, I'm not
One person come tell me we fuckin', you blocked
Watch me run this shit to the tippity-top, yeah (Keep goin')
Put my kids in Givenchy
She must think one plus one is three
I can't support your personal needs
She don't got a mortgage, moved in with her niece
These niggas be cappin', them cars be leased
Youngest in charge, I speak for the streets
I was nodding off, they woke up a beast
Struggle what made me, we used to have water for dinner, we didn't have nothin' to eat
Soon as I get on his ass, they gon' look at me better, like, ""Damn, he was fuckin' with me,"" yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist

You know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)
[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
I'm from the trenches
Niggas be tough on the 'net, but really be there for attention
Well, bitches be talkin' like they really rich, but really be beggin' me under my pictures
I'll give her forty, fifty thousand cash to start up a business
I'll spend that shit at the dentist
I'd rather fuck her and pay up her rent for a year just to get out of her feelings
I'm in the Lambo' truck in my hood, nobody gon' tell me shit
Goin' to Cali, I pick up my weed for sure, nobody gon' mail me shit
Dice game, Craps and Cee-Lo, I need cash, don't sell me shit
Baby got his hood on smash, yeah, you can tell they really rich
Drop the lo', ain't no room right now, I took her to the O
Then I pulled up on the Lam' 'cause she a fan of Boonie Moe
I got the city on lock, uh, fuckin' up all the opps
I be around with three million dollars in jewelry, I'm standin' on all the blocks
This the anthem, mmm-hmm
Droppin' the six in the Fanta, mmm
Black Rolls truck with the all-white seats, remind me of sittin' on panda, mmm
I love my cousin, she was a dancer
I love my brother, he was a scammer
Sittin' on my lap 'cause I'm pullin' her tracks and I fuck from the back 'cause she callin' me handsome (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist
All these hoes fuck on us all, I wish I would claim that bitch

And good ol' Johnny, he's the life of every party
It's like Cheers, they know him everywhere he goes

I've got some famous friends you've probably never heard of

But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends
Yeah, I do

You might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends
Yeah, I do
[Bridge: Kane Brown & Chris Young]
I got friends in high places, on these small town roads
'Cause 'round here, it's all about the people that you know

[Chorus: Chris Young & Kane Brown]
And I've got some famous friends you've probably never heard of
But back in Davidson County, our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends
Yeah, I do

Ayy
My girl is bangin', she's so low maintenance
Don't need no champagne-poppin' entertainment
Take her to Wendy's, can't keep her off me
She wanna dip me like them fries in her Frosty

[Pre-Chorus]
But every now and then, when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (Yeah)
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got some Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top, too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home
With some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (Hey)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Fancy like, ooh
Fancy like, ooh
Fancy like, ooh

[Verse 2]
Uh
Don't need no Tesla to impress her (Don't need no Tesla to impress her)
My girl is happy rollin' on a Vespa (There she go)
Don't need no mansion to get romancin' (Ooh, woo)
She's super fine, double wide, slow dancin' (Slow dancin')

[Pre-Chorus]
But every now and then, when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (Yeah)
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night (That's right)
Got some Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake (Ayy)
Get some whipped cream on the top, too (Gotta add that whipped cream)
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you (Girl, I got you)
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam (Styrofoam)
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home (All the way home)
With some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (Hey)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like

[Bridge]
My new, clean blue jeans without the holes in 'em
Country kisses on my lips without the Skoal in 'em
Yeah, she probably gon' be keepin' some Victoria's Secrets
Maybe a little Maybelline but she don't need it
In the kitchen light, radio slows down
Boxed wine, then her up-do goes down
[Chorus]
Ayy
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night (That's right)
Got some Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake (Ayy)

I'm rich but I'm ridin', I'm low on exotic, I'm 'bout to fly out and go get me some
Nothin' ain't seen, all this money on me, hunnid racks in the bag, that's a honey bun
Baby OG, I been runnin' these streets, got the game from Lashawn, I'm my mama's son
Learned 'bout the triple cross when I was young and I know I ain't goin' so I keep a gun
I flew to Paris just to buy some Dior
She beggin' for attention, I don't see her
C.I.P. Pop, I wish that you could see us
Million cash plus whenever I go re-up
I got some niggas in the street, won't beat me
I got the industry tryna be me
I just go Ray Charles, they can't see me
I'm in a Rolls-Royce with a RiRi

[Chorus: Pop Smoke & DaBaby]
I did some wrong (Oh, oh), but I'm always right (Oh, oh)

I'm livin' like ""Thriller,"" I only come out at the night time
She don't fuck with liquor, don't like bein' tipsy
She don't do the Henny, just white wine (What she do?)
Pop the cork on some new Pinot Grigio (Yeah)
I pull up in the Porsche wit' a freaky ho (Zoom)
Park the Porsche then pull up in a Lambo (Hmph)
I hop out, Major Payne, rockin' camo (Yessir)
Think she cute, make her fuck, let her man go (She cute)

English,18,Forever After All,person,Luke Combs,Forever After All by Luke Combs,"[Verse 1]
A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

[Pre-Chorus]
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

[Verse 2]
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

Here's to all the late-night drunk phone calls that you picked up
Here's to all the bad decisions that you didn't judge
All the love you's and the hate you's and the secrets that you told me
Here's to everyone but mostly us

Caught up in a moment like it's just us in this room
All the right words at the right time
And you know 'em 'cause you know me better than anyone else
We don't need anyone else

(Ah)

[Verse 1]
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (Girl)

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Verse 2]
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Break]
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

English,52,Good Days,person,SZA,Good Days by SZA,"[Verse 1: SZA]
Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit

[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent""
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

[Chorus: SZA, Jacob Collier & Both]
All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind
[Verse 2: SZA, Jacob Collier]
Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby
Heavy on my empty mind shit

[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me)
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"" (It's urgent)
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind (My mind)
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

[Chorus: SZA, Jacob Collier & Both]
All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind
[Verse 3: SZA]
Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now

[Outro: Jacob Collier]
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
You've been making me feel like I'm

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singin' ""Dixieland Delight""
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

[Verse 1]
Eighty degrees and the sun ain't even out
We got a spot a couple miles outta town
When that moon comes up, you know what's goin' down
We got them foldin' chairs leanin' way back
No other plans other than relax
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow from where we at

[Chorus]
We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singing ""Dixieland Delight""
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time
[Verse 2]
Way down here, we all got that Southern drawl
Take our time when we talkin', ""Hey Y'all""
Yeah, it don't take much for us to have it all (That's right)
Something 'bout a night this clear
Makes your problems disappear
We just gonna stay right here and let the world go by

[Chorus]
We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singing ""Dixieland Delight""
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

[Bridge]
Something 'bout a night this clear
Makes your problems disappear
So we just gonna stay right here and let the world go by

[Chorus]
We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night, al night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine, sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singing ""Dixieland Delight""
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time
[Outro]
Tryna catch a good time (Good time)
Good time
Tryna catch a good time
Good time
Yeah, we try to catch a good time (Good time)

English,94,Happier Than Ever,person,Billie Eilish,Happier Than Ever by Billie Eilish,"[Chorus]
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm
[Verse 2]
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

[Outro]
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)
(Fuck you)

Ooh

[Verse 1]
Balloons are deflated
Guess they look lifeless like me
We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
Said that you love me, but that'll last for never
It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?

[Chorus]
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?
(Oh-ooh) No
(Ooh) No, no, no
(Ooh, ooh) Ooh, nah (Ooh)
[Verse 2]
I'm buildin' my hopes up
Like presents unopened 'til this day
I still see the messages you read, mmm
I'm foolishly patient (Foolishly patient)
Can't get past the taste of your lips (Taste of your lips)
Don't wanna let you out my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
Said that you love me but that'll last for never
It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life? (My life)

[Chorus]
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?

(Last night, all I think about is you)
(Don't stop, baby, you can walk through)
(Don't want, baby, think about you)
(You know that I'm never gonna lose)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

I was no daddy's dream, was not your mama's prayer
But I was your first and your last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire when I smoked my Bronco tires
Out of that town

[Verse 2]
I'm good at rollin' dice, no good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin' life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' reckless, nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

This ain't for everybody, toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always heaven, baby, this livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you, it's a hell of a view

I paint with my old Gibson, you paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby, let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars, chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

This ain't for еverybody, toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose

I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Chance the Rapper]
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper)

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy",,2021,"R&B

Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Gabby Barrett]
I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh, baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinkin' 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

[Chorus: Gabby Barrett]
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
[Verse 2: Charlie Puth]
Yeah, babe, I hope he shows up in a 2 AM pic from a friend
Hanging on to a girl to just rub it in
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then he calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
Let him take you on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know he's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope he comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope he spends his last dime to put a rock on your hand
I hope he's wilder than your wildest dreams
He's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope he cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope he cheats
Like you did on me

[Bridge: Gabby Barrett]
I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way about her
That I feel about you right now
[Chorus: Gabby Barrett & Charlie Puth]
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy (Oh woah, oh)
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans (Oh)
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

I wouldn't mind bein' alone
I wouldn't keep checkin' my phone
Wouldn't take the long way home
Just to drive myself crazy
I wouldn't be losin' sleep
Rememberin' everything
Everything you said to me
Like I'm doin' lately

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Aldean]
You, you wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Carrie Underwood]
If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the want you off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you

[Verse 2: Carrie Underwood & Jason Aldean]
I wouldn't still cry sometimes
Wouldn't have to fake a smile
Play it off and tell a lie
When somebody asked how I've been
I'd try to find someone new (Someone new)
It should be somethin' I can do (I can do)
Baby, if it weren't for you
I wouldn't be in the state that I'm in
[Pre-Chorus: Jason Aldean & Carrie Underwood]
Yeah, you
You wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Carrie Underwood, Carrie Underwood]
If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you

Turn the want you off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you (Oh, if I didn't love you)

[Bridge: Jason Aldean & Carrie Underwood, Carrie Underwood]
It wouldn't be so hard to see you
Know how much I need you
Wouldn't hate that I still feel like I do
If I didn't love you (Oh, if I didn't love you)
If I didn't love you (Hmm, mm-hmm)

[Chorus: Carrie Underwood, Carrie Underwood & Jason Aldean]

I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for (I got what they're waiting for)
I don't run from nothing, no
Get your team, tell 'em I ain't layin' low
You were never really rooting for me anyway
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say
He don't run from nothing, no
Get your team, tell 'em that the break is over

[Verse 2: Jack Harlow]
My track record so clean, they couldn't wait to just bash me
I must be gettin' too flashy, y'all shouldn't have let the world gas me (Woo)
It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and they know that I'm ready (Mmm)
I sent her back to her boyfriend, but I’m stayin' steady
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could, but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he's toastin' to the most
I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (Ayy), where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turned my haters to supporters, I make vets feel like they juniors (Juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon, but just like Oklahoma (Mmm)
Mine is comin' sooner (Mmm), I'm just a late bloomer (Mmm)
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cooler (Woo)
All these social networks and computers
Got people actin' like they're the real winners

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for (I got what they waiting for)
I don't run from nothing, no
Get your team, tell 'em I ain't layin' low
You were never really rooting for me anyway

The way your hair’s in a mess in the morning when you open your eyes
The way an hour goes by when you say that you'll be ready in five

The little dimple on the side of your smile when you're laughing at a movie that you’ve seen about a thousand times
You know girl that I can't lie

Yeah, the flush in your cheeks when you're mad, but you say that you're not (Yeah)
And the shape of the face that you make when you’re taking a shot (Taking a shot)
The little white lie that you told the security guard
At the hotel pool when we got caught
Yeah, I was thinking girl you never looked so hot
(You never looked so hot)

English,73,Kings & Queens,person,Ava Max,Kings & Queens by Ava Max,"[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

[Verse 1]
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours

[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

[Verse 2]
Disobey me, then baby, it's off with your head
Gonna change it and make it a world you won't forget (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But I'm stronger than I ever was before

[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

[Bridge]
In chess, a king can move one space at a time
But queens are free to go wherever they like
You get too close, you'll get a royalty high
So breathe it in to feel alive

[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the way, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my mind, I want it (La-la-la-la-la-la)
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the way, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my mind, I want it

[Verse 3: SZA]
Say give me a buck, need that special touch
Push the limit, no, you ain't good enough
All your people say that you lost without me
All my friends feel like I dodged a bounty
Messin' with you feels like jail, baby (Feels like jail)
I can't even exhale, baby (Exhale)
Love so strong, like holy grail, you know that (Holy grail)
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught driftin' with your friend
You ain't even half, man, lyin' on your goals, you know that
Got me a bag full of dreams, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I go back
All this love for real (All this love)
Drama make you feel (Make you feel)
Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you

[Chorus: Doja Cat, SZA, Both]
Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, oh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you move, oh-oh
Oh, darlin'

[Post-Chorus: SZA, Doja Cat]
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the way, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my mind, I want it
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the way, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my mind, I want it

I gotta feed the streets, my pistol gon' bleed the streets
Ski mask on my face, sometimes you got to cheat
To stay ahead in this bitch-ard (Gang), drank syrup like it's liquor
Street life'll have you catchin' up to God quicker (Yeah, gang)
Sticker, AK-40 to your liver
Let the chopper bang on you like a Blood or a Cripper (Gang)
Flipper, so much bread, I'm a gymnast
Made so much money off of dummies, off of dummies (Yeah, gang)

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I'm mister body catcher (Gang), Slaughter Gang soul snatcher
Ain't no regular F-150, this a fuckin' Raptor (Yeah, gang)

Chopper hit him and he turned into a booty clapper (Gang)
Smith & Wesson, I'm 4L Gang reppin'
We done baptizеd more niggas than the damn revеrend (Yeah, gang)
Kappa Alpha, me and my gang, we do all the steppin'
Who you checkin'? This FN shoot East to West End (Gang)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
I heard Papi outside
And he got the double-R droppy outside
Checked the weather and it's gettin' real oppy outside
I'ma drop this shit and have these pussies droppin' like some motherfuckin' flies
Type of nigga that can't look me in the eyes
I despise
When I see you, better put that fuckin' pride to the side
Many times, plenty times, I survived
Beef is live, spoiler alert, this nigga dies
[Verse 3: 21 Savage]
Keep blickies, and you know the weed sticky
My finger itchy, the Glock like to leave hickeys
Your shooters iffy, a street punk could never diss me
I come straight up out the 6, and we don't spare sissies

[Verse 4: Drake]
I fuck with her, and fuck with her, and her
I hit up err, tell him do the err, for sure
Voodoo curse, it got him while I flew to Turks

And the pastor sang (Woo) and them bullets sang (Yee)
And them choppers sang (Yee) and the choir sang
[Verse 6: Drake]
I'm on everything
Jacob charged me four-fifty for a tennis chain
US Open, had it on us at the tennis game
Tell the coach don't take me out, I like to finish games
And my pen insane, am I menacin'?
There's like eighty of us now, that's the scary thing
Shit they doin' on that other side embarrassing
We in Paris with it, hundred carats with it
All this shit is for my son, 'cause he's inheritin' it

Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin', late at night
Catch me drivin' down 405
Catch me and your girl late at night, side to side
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus]
Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night
Long as you come through
I'ma make you cum over and over
I'ma treat you like I'm 'posed to
You better never make no time for these niggas
'Cause when I ride, I'ma ride, ride with you

[Verse 1]
I can't fuck with nobody
I can't keep livin' like this, I can't
I tell her what it is and I tell her what it ain't
She know that I been all in her walls like I paint
Told her at times I wanna give you trust, but I can't
Bitch, I really got it out the mud, climbin' up the ranks
When they see me outside, I'm a high roller
I've been on a global jet, but nigga, I fly solo
And I got the Gucci splattered all on her knick-knacks
Fifty racks, I'm 'bout to break her off like a KitKat
And her purse got F's like the wheels on the 'Bach
I just fucked off a million, but I still got a sack
Shorty know that I'm the realest, she know I be speakin' facts
She know that I'm the same nigga that was pushin' 'Cat
She know I got the game, but I'm never gon' give it back
Every time that we fuck, I gotta run it back
[Chorus]
Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night
Long as you come through
I'ma make you cum over and over
I'ma treat you like I'm 'posed to
You better never make no time for these niggas
'Cause when I ride, I'ma ride, ride with you

[Verse 2]
I told shorty never get too comfortable
I like to feel like the pussy untouchable
I like to feel like it's never goin' one way
I like to see your body drippin' Eliantte
I say I like the way I took ya' on a wave
I had you screamin' my name out

[Chorus]
Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night

English,45,Laugh Now Cry Later,feat,Drake Featuring Lil Durk,Laugh Now Cry Later by Drake Featuring Lil Durk,"[Intro: Drake]
Woah, woah
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
[Verse 2: Lil Durk & Drake]
I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby

Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 3: Drake]
When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

I see you calling
I didn't wanna leave you like that
It's five in the morning, yeah, yeah
A hundred on the dash
'Cause my wheels are rolling
Ain't taking my foot off the gas
And it only took the one night
To see the end of the line
Staring deep in your eyes, eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me

I'm so good at knowing
Of when to leave the party behind
Don't care if they notice, yeah, yeah, no
I'll just catch a ride, I'd rather be lonely, yeah
Than wrapped around your body too tight
Yeah, I'm the type to get naked
Won't give my heart up for breaking
'Cause I'm too gone to be staying, staying (Dancing on)

What you doin'? (What you doin'?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Oh, you got plans? (You got plans)
Don't say that (Shut your trap)
I'm sippin' wine (Sip, sip) in a robe (Drip, drip)
I look too good (Look too good)
To be alone (Woo, woo)
My house clean (House clean), my pool warm (Pool warm)
Just shaved, smooth like a newborn
We should be dancin', romancin'
In the east wing and the west wing
Of this mansion, what's happenin'?

I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms

Ooh, you're so sweet (So sweet), so tight (So tight)
I won't bite (Uh-uh), unless you like (Unless you like)
If you smoke (What you smoke?), I got the haze (Purple haze)
And if you're hungry, girl, I got filets (Woo)
Ooh, baby, don't keep me waitin'
There's so much love we could be makin' (Shamone!)
I'm talkin' kissin', cuddlin'
Rose petals in the bathtub
Girl, let's jump in, it's bubblin'

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

[Verse 2]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading

My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop

And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop

Got me froze in the road like a deer in the headlights (Uh, uh, yeah)

And she said, ""Take me to the country, show me where you from""

Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now

[Chorus]
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely

[Post-Chorus]
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid
[Chorus]
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely

I caught it bad yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place

I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Somehow, I always end up feelin' bad
Baby, I am not your dad
It's not all you want from me
I just want your company
Girl, it's obvious, elephant in the room
And we're a part of it, don't act so confused
And you love startin' it, now I'm in a mood
Now we arguin' in my bedroom

We play games of love to avoid the depression
We been here before and I won't be a victim

[Verse 2: 24kGoldn]
So why you tryna feign your love on the regular
When you could be blowin' up just like my cellular?
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough
I'm talkin' slick back, kick back, gang sippin' forties
You keep playin', not another day with you, shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well, you better save it for me
[Pre-Chorus: iann dior, iann dior & 24kGoldn]
We play games of love to avoid the depression
We been here before and I won't be a victim

Ayy
You know my ex, so that makes it all feel complicated, yeah
(It all seems complicated)
I read those texts that you sent to yours, but I'll never say it, yeah
(I'll never say—)

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
You walked in my life at 2 a.m.
'Cause my boy's new girl is your best friend
Act like you don't see me, we'll play pretend
Your eyes already told me what you never said
Now we're in the backseat of the black car, goin' home
When she asked me, ""Is it wrong if I come up with you?""
We're both drunk on the elevator
When I kiss you for the first time in New York City, uh

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & blackbear]
I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it (Yeah)

[Verse 2: blackbear]
First off, I'm not sorry, I won't apologize to nobody
You play like I'm invisible, girl, don't act like you ain't saw me
Last year was a mess and how I acted was beyond me
But the past still revolves me, you text me, I ain't responding
But now shit's done changed
Go our separate ways
But look at this damage you did to me
I still want nothin' to do between you and me
Please don't say nothin', it all sounds untrue to me
We don't got nothin' to say, hey
[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & blackbear]
I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it (Yeah)
I swear to God (I swear to God), I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it (I can't get enough of you)
I swear to God (I swear to God), I never fall in love (In love)
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it (I can't get enough of it, yeah)

[Outro: Machine Gun Kelly & blackbear]
You know my ex, so that makes it all feel complicated, yeah
(It all seems complicated)
I read those texts that you sent to yours, but I'll never say it, yeah

(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)

[Verse 1]
Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong

[Chorus]
I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex
[Verse 2]
I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

[Chorus]
I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec

Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
I don't remember much about last night
Woke up on a couch sun-rise
Saw the living room
Through these bloodshot eyes of mine, cold sober
You didn’t like that I came home late
4 AM but it's a Friday, babe
And I've been working hard
Can't you give me some space 'stead of shouting out, ""Oh my God""?

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban & P!nk]
Oh-oh, ooh-yeah
Oh-oh, ooh-yeah
I go out with some new friends
But it just makes me miss you more, more

[Chorus: Keith Urban & P!nk]
I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah
In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone
And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong?
I know I'm proud
But I've had one too many
Come take me home
[Verse 2: P!nk]
So now I'm the one that's crying
I didn't wanna call 'cause I didn't wanna fight
I swear that I was trying, yeah
But everybody falls when their head's a little high
And I've never meant to get so out my mind
With you playing cool, just pretending it's fine
Oh, we've been 'round, 'round, 'round this
Too many times before

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban & P!nk]
Oh-oh, ooh yeah
Oh-oh, ooh yeah
I go out with some new friends
But it just makes me miss you more, more

In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone
And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong?
I know I'm proud
But I've had one too many
Come take me home

I don't know how lucky, how lucky I am, I am, I am, no
I guess sometimes I should give more of a damn, a damn, a damn about you
I don't know how lucky, how lucky I am, I am, I am, no
I know we're both stubborn
Push each other's buttons
I'd rather do it with you, but...
I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah
In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone
[Chorus: Keith Urban & P!nk]
I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah
In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone

But I'm for ya
All I can want, all I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs

Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn’t hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa

I can’t pretend, I can't ignore, you're right for me
Don't think you wanna know just where I've been, oh
Done bein' distracted
The one I need is right in my arms (Oh)
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine

It's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothin' from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride

[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

[Verse 2]
I'm gеtting used to receiving
Still gеtting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared (Oh, scared)
Learnin' to be grateful for myself (Oh, oh, oh)
You love my lips 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine
[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

I couldn't believe it or see it for myself
Know I be impatient
But now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'
Frozen, slowly thawin', got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely (My baggage fadin')
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away

Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too

Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate

[Chorus]
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

[Post-Chorus]
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

[Verse 2]
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more that they seem to change
Don't ya think it's strange?

[Chorus]
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

[Post-Chorus]
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

(Shout out my nigga Synco)

[Chorus]
Uh (Tuned up), copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

[Verse 1]
Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—
[Chorus]
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it (Uh, uh)
And we might have a child when I'm finished

[Verse 2]
They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought
[Chorus]
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

(Shout out my guy Synco)

[Chorus]
Uh (Tuned up), copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like, forget it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds cheerin', money counters, chains ringin'
I guess that's how it sounds when you're winnin'
I ain't jokin', does it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I've been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was driftin'
I'm probably gon' float when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

[Verse 1]
Uh, I won't fall in love, after we talk, she can't get near me
Only voice I give a conversation to is Siri
My style Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, they saw my potential, so they fear me
Lately, I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss it dearly
Stay down 'til you rise up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day’s a battle, I'm exhausted, but I'm steady
Make sure I smile in public, though alone, I feel heavy
I fought through it all, but the pain cut me deeply
I've been stayin' high to cope with insecurities
But I know it ain't the answer—

[Chorus]
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like, forget it, I'ma count while I'm in it

And we might have a child when I'm finished

[Verse 2]
They say I'm the rebirth of legends, never put out a weak verse
People hurt, I keep goin' strong even when my feet hurt
Been out here puttin' in work
White tees turned burgundy shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he's stuck in a deep search
Anxiety keeps buildin', sometimes I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it only makes it seem worse
Try to explain your feelings, it sounds like a rehearse
Stabbed me in the back, but they smiled first
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can feel your thoughts, so
Quiet down—, I mean, please don't talk
I've been through too much, I can't handle another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought

Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly""

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancin' merrily
In the new old-fashioned way

English,95,Single Saturday Night,person,Cole Swindell,Single Saturday Night by Cole Swindell,"[Verse 1]
I was out taking shots
Throwing down at the spot
Three sheets, just me and the guys
Every single Saturday night
I was killing time, crushing cans
Trying not to catch a tan
'Cause I was under them neon lights
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Everybody knew they could find me there
And right out of the blue, right out of nowhere
Out of nowhere

[Chorus]
Sittin’ over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin' to a little “Shook Me All Night Long”
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a mornin’ you don't wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin' out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah
My last single Saturday night

[Verse 2]
And now when I'm out, havin' a drink or two
If they see me, huh, they see you
'Cause, girl, I got you by my side
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Every now and then, the boys tell me they miss me
Oh but they all get it 'cause they were right there with me
Yeah with me, when
[Chorus]
Sittin’ over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin’ to a little, “Shook Me All Night Long”
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a morning you don’t wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin' out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?

[Bridge]
The last time that I'd buy a drink for a girl I’d never met before
I wasn't looking for love when I walked through the door
But damn if I didn't find what I wasn't even looking for

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Sittin' over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin' to a little “Shook Me All Night Long”
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a morning you don't wake up in my shirt now
Look at us even pickin' out a church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah

English,53,Starting Over,person,Chris Stapleton,Starting Over by Chris Stapleton,"[Verse 1]
Well, the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand

[Verse 2]
And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

[Pre-Chorus]
And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

[Chorus]
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

[Verse 3]
This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days, we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
[Verse 4]
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday, we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

[Pre-Chorus]
And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

[Chorus]
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
[Chorus]
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?

[Verse 1]
Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh
[Chorus]
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing
And it's motherfuckin' scary
Tryna keep him 'cause I found him
Let a ho know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)
Like the birds of a feather, baby (Woo)
We real life made for each other (Woo)
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you
[Chorus]
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through

[Post-Chorus]
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?",,2021,"Pop

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I saw the fire in your eyes
I saw the fire when I look into your eyes
You tell me things you wanna try (Uh)
I know temptation is the devil in disguise
You risk it all to feel alive, oh yeah
You're offering yourself to me like sacrifice
You said you do this all the time
Tell me you love me if I bring you to the light

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like a dream what she feels with me
She loves to be on the edge
Her fantasy is okay with me
Then suddenly, baby says

Take my breath away
And make it last forever, babe
Do it now or never, babe (Ah)
Take my breath away
Nobody does it better, babe
Bring me close to—
[Verse 2]
Want me to hold on to you tight
You pull me closer, feel the heat between your thighs (Uh, say)
You're way too young to end your life (Huh)
Girl, I don't wanna be the one who pays the price

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, it's like a dream what she feels with me
She loves to be on the edge
Her fantasy is okay with me
Then suddenly, baby says

And make it last forever, babe
Do it now or never, babe (Ah)
Take my breath away
Nobody does it better, babe
Bring me close to heaven, babe (Uh)

[Coro]
Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

[Verso 1]
You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

[Coro]
Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
[Verso 2]
You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
(On repeat)

[Coro]
Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

He's a phone call to his parents
He's a Bible by the bed
He's the T-shirt that I'm wearing
He's the song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

[Pre-Chorus]
One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

[Chorus]
A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one

But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

[Verse 2]
You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
[Pre-Chorus]
He's one of the good ones

[Chorus]
A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one

He's one of the good ones

They're out there, minus one

English,25,Therefore I Am,person,Billie Eilish,Therefore I Am by Billie Eilish,"[Chorus]
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

[Verse 1]
Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name out of your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal

[Pre-Chorus]
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

[Chorus]
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
[Verse 2]
I don't want press to put your name next to mine
We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff
'Cause I hate to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain unremarkable (Got a lotta)
Interviews, interviews, interviews
When they say your name, I just act confused

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you have fun?
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

[Chorus]
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

[Bridge]
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
[Chorus]
I'm not your friend (I'm not your friend)
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man (They wanna, they can try)
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend (I'm not your friend)
Or anything, damn (They wanna)
You think that you're the man

Yeah, I know a few things a man oughta know

How to know when it's love
How to stay when it's tough
How to know you're messin' up a good thing

(And if the beat live, you know Lil Ju made it)

[Verse 1]
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Post me a pic, finna make me a profit
When the liquor hit, then a bitch get toxic
(Why the fuck you in the club when niggas wildin’?)
I've been lit since brunch, thot shit
Order '42 for the table, let’s pop shit
Missionary or doggystyle, I'ma top shit
Pussy-ass niggas hatin' on me from the closet, ah
Hoes tryna call me a snake, shit, I guess I can relate
'Cause a bitch spit a whole lotta venom
And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me
All I see is a whole lotta dinner
I walk around the house butt-naked
And I stop at every mirror just to stare at my own posterior
I don't give a fuck who talk behind my back
'Cause the bitch knew better than to let me hear her (Ah)

[Chorus]
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit (Thot shit)
Hands on my knees, shakin’ ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, ha-hands on my knees
Hands on my knees, shakin’ ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit (Thot shit)
Hands on my knees, shakin’ ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, hands on my knees
[Verse 2]
Hoes said they wish a bitch would, and I'm a genie
Bitch so hot, gotta stay in bikinis
He got a girl, but he keep beggin' to see me
I love it when a nigga got a mouth full of VVs
No, I'm not a patient, but I let him treat me
I gotta be a doctor how I’m orderin' CCs
Go to your place, no face, no case
Ninety-nine percent tint in a blacked-out Wraith
I remember hoes used to clap for me happily
Now I'm bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
Acting like they ridin', whole time tryna pass me
Watchin' me go through it and still tryna drag me
Actin' like you winnin', if you think about it, actually
Are they supportin' you or really just attackin' me?
I don't give a fuck 'bout a blog tryna bash me
I'm the shit per the Recording Academy (Ah)

[Chorus]
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit (Thot shit)
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, ha-hands on my knees
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit

Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, hands on my knees

Drinkin' out the motherfuckin' bottle on my thot shit
Everything I eat go straight to my pockets
2021, finna graduate college
Goth girl shit, I'm a real hot topic
Fuckin' on a nigga, make him sing, on some pop shit
I need a real headbanger, on some rock shit
Pussy like crack, wanna hit it like dope
Got a real hot box, but a bitch don't smoke (Ah)
Hot girl, but I'm still the coldest, hey
I'm the big homie, but I ain't the oldest, hmm
Bitch dry hatin', tryna get noticed
Man, ain't nobody come to see you, Otis, look
How many bitches lyin' if they say they bars is better?
They really puppets, so I really gotta go and Geppetto
I'm really talkin', but it really can apply to whoever
My pen a freak, it'll go after a bitch or a nigga (Huh)
Big bank take lil' bank, bitch, add it up
Hoes takin' shots, but they ain't in my caliber
Booked, but I squeeze a lil' head in my calendar
Lookin' in the mirror like, ""Damn, I don't brag enough""
LVs, double C's, Birkins, I'm workin'
My chain ain't hittin' if a bitch ain't hurtin'
Look, I ain't even finna argue with a bitch
One thing I know, two things for certain
None of these hoes sayin' shit to my face
And none of these hoes finna see me at the bank
And I'ma keep talkin' all the shit that I want
And I dare one of these hoes come tell me I can't
We ain't even speakin' if the nigga ain't spendin'
He could never say that I was one of his women
I don't even let niggas know where I stay
I'll be damned if he thinkin' he poppin' up on this pimpin' (Ah)
[Chorus]
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit (Thot shit)
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, ha-hands on my knees
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit (Thot shit)
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, hands on my knees

(Why you in the club when things get hectic?)
I've been lit since brunch, hot stuff
Order '42 for the table, let’s pop up
Missionary or doggy style, I'ma top it
People hatin' on me from the sidelines, ah
Folks tryna call me a snake, guess I can relate
'Cause I can spit a whole lotta wisdom
And since these folks all chat, when they come around me
All I see is a whole lotta drama
I walk around the house just chillin'
And I stop at every mirror just to admire my reflection
I don't care who talks behind my back

[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three, four
Dice, Ra-Rauw

[Verso 1]
El viento soba tu cabello
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Me matan esos ojos bellos
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Me gusta tu olor, de tu piel el color
Y cómo me haces sentir
Me gusta tu boquita, ese labial rosita
Y cómo me besas a mí (Yeh)

[Pre-Estribillo]
Contigo quiero despertar
Hacerlo después de fumar (Ey)
Ya no tengo na' que buscar
Algo fuera de aquí
Tú combinas con el mar
Ese bikini se ve fenomenal
No hay gravedad que me pueda elevar
Me pones mal a mí (¡Yah!)
[Estribillo]
Aceleras to’ mis latidos
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti
De toa' tus parte’, ¿cuál decido?
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti

[Post-Estribillo]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti

[Verso 2]
Quinta Avenida, no va pa'l mall
Ella sabe que le llego a solo un call
En la Raptor me gusta ponerla en four
El jogger large, la camisa small
Como la dieta keto
Por ti, me controlo y me quedo quieto
Aunque quiero comerte to' eso completo
De ese culo me volví un teco, eh
Mi-Mi-Micro dosi', rola, oxi
Besando eso' labio’ glossy
Ya yo le di en to’a la' posi
Champú de coco, Chanel su wallet
Me vuelve loco desde el casco hasta lo’ pedale'
[Pre-Estribillo]
Contigo quiero despertar (Oh-oh)
Hacerlo después de fumar
Ya no tengo na' que buscar
Algo fuera de aquí
Tú combinas con el mar (Eh)
Ese bikini se ve fenomenal (Eh-eh)
No hay gravedad que me pueda elevar
Me pones mal a mí (¡Yah!)

[Estribillo]
Aceleras to' mis latidos
Y e’ que me gusta todo de ti
De toa' tus parte', ¿cuál decido?
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti

Ah, ah-ah (Todo de ti), ah-ah (Todo de ti), ah-ah
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti

When I was down to talk, you weren't here for it

The dirt you left don't turn into dust, it don't move (Ooh)
It's here waiting for you (Ooh)

Girl, you killing me, you tweakin' hard (Girl, you tweakin')
I asked you what you feel and you don't speak at all (Oh no)
But you go straight to Twitter, you gon' tweet it all (Oh why?)
You must want another nigga to be alarmed (What you want see?)
We were 'posed to fight through the storm
You made a decision, chose the easy one
Say you following your heart, but girl you leaving one
Wanting me to take you back with open reaching arms (And I can't do that, mama)

Hard times, wait for it and then she break for it (And then she break, yeah)
Love don't cost a thing, ashamed how much I paid for it (I'm ashamed)
Love don't cost a thing ashamed how much I gave for it

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
Brown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

[Pre-Chorus]
And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

[Chorus]
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

[Verse 2]
Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly
[Pre-Chorus]
And ain't it funny? All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid
Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid?

[Chorus]
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

[Bridge]
(Ah-ah-ah)
God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
(Ah-ah-ah)
When she's sleepin' in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way

[Chorus]
You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
You gave me your word, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still, you're still a traitor
(Ah-ah-ah)
Yeah, you're still a traitor

I could make the party hot, I could make your body rock
Bitches say they fuckin' with me, chances are they probably not
If I had a dick, you'd probably lick it like a lollipop
Hoes speakin' cap-enese, hit 'em with karate chop
I'm forever poppin' shit, pullin' up and droppin' shit
Gotta argue with him 'cause a nigga love a toxic bitch
Niggas out here playin', gotta make 'em understand
If ain't no ring on my finger, you ain't goin' on my 'Gram

Bitches ain't fuckin' with me now and I can see why
Dirty-ass, dusty-ass bitch, you got pink eye
Bitches want smoke until I bring it to they doorstep
Tell that bitch back back, breath smell like horse sex (Ha)
Put it on him now, he will never be the same (He won't)
Tatted on my ass 'cause I really like the pain (Ah)
He nutted on my butt, I said, ""I'm glad that you came""
If that nigga had a twin, I would let 'em run a train (Skrrt)

Racks stack up real high
Jewelry on me, shining bright
I’ve been lit since last night
Bringing all that good, good
Make the crowd act right

I could make the party hot, I could make your body rock
People say they hangin' with me, chances are they probably not
I stay speaking my own truth, got no time for playin' games
Staying focused, chasing goals, making moves and taking names

Gotta stay motivated, nothing’s ever as it seems

They ain't hangin' with me now, and I can see why
Jealousy and hate can never bring me down, I rise
People talkin' loud, but they never step up to the plate
I keep my focus high, I never engage in hate (Ha)
Keep on movin', now, things will never be the same (It won't)
Focused on my future, I’m climbin’ to the fame
Always keep it real, I’m stayin’ in my lane

English,47,Wants And Needs,feat,Drake Featuring Lil Baby,Wants And Needs by Drake Featuring Lil Baby,"[Intro: Drake]
(Six)
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us
[Chorus: Drake]
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I'm from the four, but I love me a threesome
DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter (Skrrt)
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out ""YOLO,"" yeah, that's still the motto
I know I be on some shit that they ain't thought of
[Chorus: Drake]
Sins, I got sins on my mind

I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

[Chorus]
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

[Verse 2]
No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else

Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good

She said, ""What you know 'bout love?"" (I'll tell you everything)
I got what you need (Oh)
Walk up in the store and get what you want (Go get it)
You get what you please
We 'bout to have some fun, let's turn up the songs (I said I love you, baby)
It's just you and me
You know what I be on, I'm here for the long (I love you, baby)
'Cause I like what I see (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Look, baby, I said I ain't gon' front (Uh)
You got my heart beatin' so fast, I can barely talk
And I be gettin' the chills every time I feel your touch
I be lookin' at the top and girl, it's only us
All I need is your trust
And girl I told you once, don't make me tell you twice (Word)
I know you see this fit and it's lookin' nice (Like, nah)
And your style be lookin' so fresh when you step out tonight (In them tights)
And I'm goin' straight to the top, so hope you're feelin' right
You always keep me close, for a fact, you never left (Left)
Through all the trials and tribulations, always gave your best (Your best)
So here's somethin' special, you deserve the best (Your best)
Start holdin' onto your dreams, start lovin' on yourself
Hey batter, batter, hey batter, batter (Batter)
People know I had to swing, I had to make a play (Make a play)
I had to apply the pressure, 'cause you’re my hidden treasure
I think I'm fallin' in love

[Chorus]
She said, ""What you know 'bout love?"" (I'll tell you everything)
I got what you need (Oh)
Walk up in the store and get what you want (Go get it)
You get what you please

Did you grow up on a tractor?
Did your daddy let you drive?
Are you whiskey bent and hell bound?
Even though your mama tried
Did you cruise down a backroad
With your Dixieland Delight?
Are you on the Chattahoochee
On a barefoot blue jean night?

[Chorus]
Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?

[Verse 2]
Do your exes live in Texas?
Are you so lonesome you could cry?
Are you heart-broke 'cause you know
That ain't your truck in her drive?
Are your friends all in low places
Underneath the neon moon?
Were you already country
Back when country wasn't cool?
[Chorus]
Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?

Who's your strawberry wine?
What's your family tradition?
What makes you turn it up?
Makes you raise your cup every time you listen?

Everybody got a hallelujah

English,55,Willow,person,Taylor Swift,Willow by Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
[Bridge]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man",,2021,"Pop

English,17,Without You,person,The Kid LAROI,Without You by The Kid LAROI,"[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Verse]
I can't believe that you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons
I lost my shit, you know I didn't mean it
Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
So there you go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone

[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you
[Bridge]
It's gon' be hard here on my own
And even harder to let you go
I really wish that we, could have got this right

So here I go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone (Oh)

[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you (No, no, no)",,2021,"Pop

English,42,Wockesha,person,Moneybagg Yo,Wockesha by Moneybagg Yo,"[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute but umm
But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup, what's in your cup, what's in they cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up (Haha)

[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (Candy), sweet like fruit (Ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)

[Pre-Chorus]
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
[Chorus]
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the liter
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

[Verse 2]
Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (Too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (That strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home (In my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (That somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it

[Pre-Chorus]
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that

[Pre-Coro]
Una noche más y copas de más
Tú no me dejas en paz, de mi mente no te vas

[Coro]
Aunque sé que no debo, ey
Pensar en ti, bebé, pero cuando bebo
Me viene tu nombre, tu cara, tu risa y tu pelo, ey
Dime dónde tú está', que yo por ti cojo un vuelo
Y a Yonaguni le llego, oh
Aunque sé que no debo, ey
Pensar en ti, bebé, pero cuando bebo
Me viene tu nombre, tu cara, tu risa y tu pelo, ey
Dime dónde tú está', que yo por ti cojo un vuelo
Y a Yonaguni le llego, ey

No me busque' en Instagram, mami, búscame en casa
Pa' que vea' lo que pasa, ey
Si tú me prueba', te casa', ey
Ese cabrón ni te abraza
Y yo loco por tocarte
Pero ni me atrevo a textearte
Tú con cualquier outfit la parte'
Mami, tú ere' aparte
Shorty, tiene' un culo bien grande, eh
De-Demasia'o grande
Y yo lo tengo estudia'o, ya mismo me gradúo
Y en la cara me lo tatúo
Vi que viste mi story y subiste una pa' mí
Yo que me iba a dormir, ey
En la disco habían mil
Y yo bailando contigo en mi mente

Aunque sé que no debo
Pensar en ti, bebé, pero cuando bebo
Me viene tu nombre, tu cara, tu risa y tu pelo, ey
Dime dónde tú está', que yo por ti cojo un vuelo
Y a Yonaguni le llego

Si me da' tu dirección, yo te mando mil carta'
Si me da' tu cuenta de banco, un millón de peso'
To'a la noche arrodillado a Dio' le rezo
Pa' que ante' que se acabe el año tú me de' un beso
Y empezar el 2023 bien cabrón
Contigo y un blunt
Tú te ve' asesina con ese mahón (¡Wuh!)
Me matas sin un pistolón
Y yo te compro un Banshee
Gucci, Givenchy
Un poodle, un frenchie
El pasto, lo' munchie'
Te canto un mariachi
Me convierto en Itachi, eh

You broke me first

[Verse 1]
Maybe you don't like talkin' too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinkin' 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months, so you're callin' me now

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

[Chorus]
Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

[Verse 2]
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while, I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say
[Pre-Chorus]
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

[Chorus]
Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

[Bridge]
What did you think would happen?
What did you think would happen?
I'll never let you have it
What did you think would happen?

[Chorus]
Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts

Tryna be all through your sheets
Have you all on top of me

Oh, you could take it out on me

Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

[Bridge]
I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

Oh, oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go
[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Bridge]
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles

Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at

[Verse 1]
I was out back where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at (Yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Nigga try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (Yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em
Got a bitch that's looking like Aaliyah, she a model
I got the pink slip, all my whips is key-less
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city
Patek like the sea, forgive me

The private I'm flyin' in, I never wan' fly again
I'll take my chances in traffic (Yeah)
She suckin' on dick, no hands with it
I just made the Rollie plain like a landing strip
I'm a 2020 president candidate
I done put a hundred bands on Zimmerman, shit
I been movin' real gangster, so that's why she picked a Crip

If you don't wanna see me

[Verse 1]
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

[Refrain]
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
[Refrain]
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)

If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now (So)

Woo, woo
I pull up like
How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
How you pull up? I pull up (Woo, SethInTheKitchen)

[Chorus: DaBaby]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

[Verse 1: DaBaby]
It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: DaBaby & Roddy Ricch]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car

You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo, yeah)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

[Chorus: Drake]
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush

[Verse: Drake]
Say my days are numbered, but I keep wakin' up
Know you see my texts, baby, please say some'
Wine by the glass, your man a cheapskate, huh?
Niggas gotta move off my release day, huh
Bitch, this is fame, not clout
I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth
Baby got a ego twice the size of the crib
I can never tell her shit, it is what it is (What)
Said what I had to and did what I did (Ayy)
Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid
Virgil got the Patek on my wrist doin' front flips
Givin' you my number, but don't hit me on no dumb shit
[Chorus: Drake]
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual (Like usual)
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush

Yeah, hunnid thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo

[Verse 1: Future]
Granny, she was standin' right there while I catch a play on a brick, woo

I done been down bad in them trenches, had to ride with that stick, woo
Who gave you pills? Who gave you that dust? Pluto sent you on a lick, woo
Too many convicts that roll with me to play in this shit, woo
I'm tryna avoid nonsense, get Osama spray in this bitch, woo
They at the candlelight lightin' it up, nigga, anybody can get it, woo
I'm on a PJ lightin' it up, Backwood full of sticky, woo

[Chorus: Drake]
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual
People swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
They caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this place too plush

[Verse: Drake]
Say my days are numbered, but I keep wakin' up
Know you see my texts, baby, please say somethin'
Wine by the glass, your man a cheapskate, huh?
People gotta move off my release day, huh
This is fame, not clout
I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth
Baby got an ego twice the size of the crib
I can never tell her stuff, it is what it is (What)
Said what I had to and did what I did (Ayy)
Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid
Virgil got the Patek on my wrist doin' front flips
Givin' you my number, but don't hit me on no nonsense

We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
[Bridge]
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

[Chorus]
For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall

English,11,Say So,person,Doja Cat,Say So by Doja Cat,"[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily, I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Yeah)
[Verse 2]
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it bad
Take it, own it, steal it fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

English,12,I Hope,feat,Gabby Barrett Featuring Charlie Puth,I Hope by Gabby Barrett Featuring Charlie Puth,"[Intro: Charlie Puth]
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Gabby Barrett]
I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh, baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinkin' 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

[Chorus: Gabby Barrett]
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
[Verse 2: Charlie Puth]
Yeah, babe, I hope he shows up in a 2 AM pic from a friend
Hanging on to a girl to just rub it in
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then he calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
Let him take you on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know he's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope he comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope he spends his last dime to put a rock on your hand
I hope he's wilder than your wildest dreams
He's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope he cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope he cheats
Like you did on me

[Bridge: Gabby Barrett]
I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way about her
That I feel about you right now
[Chorus: Gabby Barrett & Charlie Puth]
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy (Oh woah, oh)
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans (Oh)
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Back with the remix
These boys all my sons like Phoenix (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
My city and state never ever seen this
Jimmy Neutron, I'm a young boy genius (Oh Lord, jetson made another one)
On the futon, I'ma give her that penis
When this shit's done, I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, like Gilbert Arenas
Shoot my shot, I'm still with the demons, ooh
I keep it thorough
I got five chicks in New York, that means one in each borough
I'm in the pocket like Burrow
When I'm back home, though, they treat me like Robert De Niro
Took her to Taco Bell, bought her a churro
Took her home, gave her a cinnamon swirl
I left it in, now I got a one-year-old
Zeros on zeros on zeros (Zeros)
That's what my bank account balance say (Woo)
I got a check from the shoe company
Now I do anything that New Balance say
I bought her a plane ticket, out of state
I got me a shorty from 'round the way
Said, ""I'm in town today""
She said she comin' over and she down to stay
I got a hit, she been playin' that shit
So when she pull up on me, I know what she 'bout to say
[Chorus: Jack Harlow & DaBaby]
What's poppin'?
Brand-new whip, just hopped in (Just hopped in)
I got options
I could pass that bitch like Stockton (It ain't nothin')
Just joshin' (Oh, these niggas got me fucked up, nigga)
I'ma spend this holiday locked in (Ooh, you know, it's like)
My body got rid of them toxins (Let me go, let me go, mm, mm)
SportsCenter, top ten

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Call up my bitch, tell her, ""Bring me that noggin"" (Brrt)
Brain real good, she a scholar
I like the thing with low mileage, good brain with no college
Call me DaBaby, no toddler (Wah)
I'm real creative and stylish, FN in my denim
I send a hit, make him spin 'em
And I just flew back from L.A. on the jet yesterday (Nyoom)
I go back and forth like I play tennis
I fuck with your ho, yeah, I'm fit for it
Still on the Billboard, the number one song in UK
And I done got so fuckin' rich, all these hoes on my dick
I still don't give a fuck what you say
She eat it like a Pac-Man, nigga (Eat it)
Whoop a nigga like I'm Batman, nigga (Eat it)
I just pulled up in the Batmobile (Nyoom)
The reason I ain't fuckin' with these rap-ass niggas
'Cause they cap-ass niggas (Cap), and they raps ain't real (Cap)
Believe me, you wanna keep your life, then take it easy
I'm rockin' water diamonds, need a Squeegee
These niggas watered down, they drinkin' Fiji
My whip is orange and brown like I'm in Cleveland
My bitch is Mello Yello like a soda (Soda)
These niggas tattletalers, I'm a soldier
Ayy, somebody tell them niggas that it's over
You know it's Baby, nigga

Brand-new whip, just hopped in (Woo, hahaha)

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
Hop out that Scat and I caught her
I'm out here with somebody daughter
She callin' me daddy, I'm somebody father
I gotta go gets it, I will not go kiss it
Or put my lips on it like somebody water
The diamond, the glacier, the card in the wallet
She pulled up to fuck me but nobody caught her
She told me that she wasn't feelin' my music
I fucked her, she told me, ""It's nobody harder""
And I'm with the G-ski, I need that shit for the freeski
We are not buyin' no pussy you sellin' on Peachtree
It's so much work on my celly
I had to go tell all my bitches, ""Email it to reach me""
All in my DM, I'll follow your BM
She play with the croski, we used to fuck on the lowski
She use to lie on my bed and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski, nigga, you knows me
You ain't believe it, you wanted to toast me
I had extendi as long as a ruler
In case you was coolin' and wanna approach me
Dropped the Bentayga, came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again, I want that tongue again
Stuck it so deep that she cough up her lung again
Five-star bitches, they on the run again, run again
Runnin' in diamonds, they illuminatin' the way that I come again
I just put so many pennies on the watch
That I don't ever got to stunt again, nigga, lil' Tory

These boys all my sons like Phoenix
My city and state never ever seen this
Jimmy Neutron, I'm a young boy genius
On the futon, I'ma chill with finesse
When this all ends, I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, like Gilbert Arenas
Shoot my shot, I'm still with the team, yes
I keep it thorough
I got five friends in New York, that means one in each borough
I'm in the pocket like Burrow
When I'm back home, though, they treat me like Robert De Niro
Took her to Taco Bell, bought her a churro
Took her home, gave her a cinnamon swirl
I stayed around, now I got a one-year-old
Zeros on zeros on zeros
That's what my bank account balance say
I got a check from the shoe company
Now I do anything that New Balance say
I bought her a plane ticket, out of state
I got me a friend from 'round the way
Said, ""I'm in town today""
She said she's comin' over and she's down to stay
I got a hit, she's been playin' that track
So when she pulls up on me, I know what she 'bout to say

[Chorus: Jack Harlow & DaBaby]
What's poppin'?
Brand-new whip, just hopped in (Just hopped in)
I got options
I could pass that vibe like Stockton
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in
My body got rid of them toxins
SportsCenter, top ten

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Call up my friend, tell her, ""Bring me that noggin""
Brain real sharp, she a scholar
I like the vibe with low mileage, good brain without college
Call me DaBaby, no toddler
I'm real creative and stylish, FN in my denim
I send a hit, make 'em spin 'em
And I just flew back from L.A. on the jet yesterday
I go back and forth like I play tennis
I vibe with your crew, yeah, I'm fit for it
Still on the Billboard, the number one song in the UK
And I've done got so well-known, all these folks on my track
I still don't give a fuss what you say
She enjoys it like a snack, man
Whoop 'em like I'm Batman
I just pulled up in the Batmobile
The reason I ain't vibin' with these rap-type folks
'Cause they cap-type people, and their tracks ain't real
Believe me, you wanna keep your vibe, then take it easy
I'm rockin' water diamonds, need a squeegee
These folks watered down, they drinkin' Fiji
My whip is orange and brown like I'm in Cleveland
My vibe is bright like Mello Yello
These folks tattletales, I'm a soldier
Ayy, somebody tell them it's over
You know it's Baby, yes

[Chorus: Jack Harlow & Tory Lanez]
What's poppin'?
Brand-new whip, just hopped in
I got options
I could pass that vibe like Stockton

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
Hop out that ride and I caught her
I'm out here with somebody's daughter
She callin' me daddy, I'm somebody's father
I gotta go gets it, I will not go kiss it",2020,"Rap

Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Shout-out to your mom and dad for makin' you
Standin' ovation, they did a great job raisin' you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
You make it easy to choose
You got a mean touch, I can't refuse (No, I can't refuse it)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention

Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Already passed, you don't need no approval
Good everywhere, don't worry 'bout no refusal
Second to none, you got the upper hand now
Don't need a sponsor, nope, you're the brand now
You're my rock, my Colorado
Got that ring, just like Toronto
Love you now, a little more tomorrow
This how I feel, act like you know that you are

[Verse 3: Quavo]
No cap, no pretendin', you don't need mentions (No cap)
Got 'em sayin' ""goals,"" they don't wanna be independent ('Pendent)
Tell them to mind your business (Woo), we in our feelings
It's fifty-fifty percentage (Fifty), attention, we need commitment (Oh)
We gotta both admit it (Both), it's funny, we both listen (Both)
It's a blessing (Blessing) 'cause we both get it (Both)

English,18,Everything I Wanted,person,Billie Eilish,Everything I Wanted by Billie Eilish,"[Verse 1]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""
[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

[Outro]
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?",,2020,"Pop

Roses
I walked in the corner with the body screaming dolo
Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
You already know though, you already know though
I walk in the corner with the money, on my finger
She might get it popping, I might wife her for the winter
I already know, already know, nigga roses
All I need is roses

[Chorus]
Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
And I know you won't tell nobody no

[Verse 2]
Roses
I might pull up flexing on these niggas like aerobics
I might tell her girl you cute but balling
That shit gorgeous
Standing on the table, Rosé, Rosé, fuck the waters
You know who the god is
[Chorus]
Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw

[Verse 3]
I might bring them Brooklyn niggas out, oh lord it's overs
I might bring them strippers out and tell 'em do it pole-less
You already know, already know, nigga roses
Kill 'em, make it ...

[Chorus]
Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
And I know you won't tell nobody no

I walked in the corner with the vibe feeling solo
Never moved a thing but look like I'm straight from a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony lost his bro, though
You already know, though, you already know, though
I walk in the corner with the money in my sights
She might get it poppin', I might keep her through the nights
I already know, already know, it's all roses
All I need is roses

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on

English,21,Before You Go,person,Lewis Capaldi,Before You Go by Lewis Capaldi,"[Verse 1]
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

[Chorus]
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

[Verse 2]
Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

[Chorus]
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

[Bridge]
Would we be better off by now
If I'da let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

[Chorus]
Before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go",,2020,"Pop

Oh
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

[Verse]
Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need ya
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown out pain by pourin' up
Speedin' fast on the run, never wanna get caught up
Now you're the one that I'm callin'
Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

[Bridge]
Feeling like I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got eyes for ya
Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feelin' ya
Think I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one
[Chorus]
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

[Outro]
Will never give my all again
'Cause I'm sick of falling down
When I open up and give my trust
They find a way to break it down
Break down
Tear me up inside

Whores in this house

Wet-ass pussy, make that pullout game weak, woo (Ah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy

[Verse 1: Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion]
Beat it up, nigga, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel while it's inside
Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm a surprise
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring (Ayy, ayy)
[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me (Yeah)
Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me (Yeah)
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be (Huh)
I'll run down on him 'fore I have a nigga runnin' me (Pow, pow, pow)
Talk your shit, bite your lip (Yeah)
Ask for a car while you ride that dick (While you ride that dick)
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang (Yeah)
He already made his mind up 'fore he came (Ayy, ah)
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet-ass pussy (Ah, ah, ah)
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet-ass pussy (Click, click, click)
Paid my tuition just to kiss me on this wet-ass pussy (Mwah, mwah, mwah)
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet-ass pussy (Yeah, yeah)

Look, I need a hard hitter, need a deep stroker
Need a Henny drinker, need a weed smoker
Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1 just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me (Yeah, ah)
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo
[Verse 4: Megan Thee Stallion]
Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a beatin' (Ah)
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask ""Whose is it?""
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Now from the top, make it drop, that's some wet-ass pussy
Now get a bucket and a mop, that's some wet-ass pussy
I'm talkin' wap, wap, wap, that's some wet-ass pussy
Macaroni in a pot, that's some wet-ass pussy, huh

Groove with me, move with me, let it go naturally (Yeah)

Brought the heat, just to feel these top-tier vibes (Mwah, mwah, mwah)
Let it rain, keep it steady with the top-tier vibes (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion]
Look, I need a rhythm-maker, need a deep groove
Need a mood-setter, need a smooth move
Not a fleeting beat, I need a strong pulse
With a hook in it, hope it catches close
He's got the talent, that's where I'm headed
Bringing A-game, nothing's regretted
He's got the vibe, well, I'm tryna catch it
I let him feel it, now it's magnetic
I don't wanna stop, I wanna groove
I wanna vibe, I wanna move
I want you to catch that moment, hold tight
Keep it flowing all night, keep the vibe right
My beat's on fire, got that spark
It’s keeping the night alive after dark
I ride on this groove like the crowd's behind me (Yeah, ah)
I’m bringing the sound, let it define me, woo

[Verse 4: Megan Thee Stallion]
Your honor, I’m a vibe queen, got the flow, unleashing
Switch my style, keep it fresh and intriguing
Set the tone, give them something to believe in
Never back down, always ready for achieving (Ah)
In the game, I'm the one that's leading
Setting the trend, watch the vibe exceeding
Top level stands for big demeanor
I could make waves before you even see it
If it ain't strong, then it won't stay
I keep the rhythm, groove all day",2020,"Pop

I don't really wanna go
I don't really wanna stay
But I really hope and pray
Can we get it together?
Get it together
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty

[Verse 1: Roddy Ricch]
All this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my bitch a new coupe
Either you from the Yah Gang or you're SuWoop
Got a New Orleans bitch and man, that pussy voodoo
And I'm that nigga now, who knew?
[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath

I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
I been wakin' up to get the money, woah, woah
Got a bad bitch, her ass tatted, woah, woah
Givenchy to my toes, two twins, I'm fucking 'em both
I put her in a new AP, the water like a boat
I was down bad on my dick, where was you niggas at?
I know you turned your back on me just to get some racks
I seen you swerve back, 'cause I'm in the black 'Bach
New diamonds on me, fuck a flash, this ain't Snapchat
'Cause I been gettin' paid
Yellow diamonds on me look like lemonade
Got my baby mama that new Bentayga
Tryna get the dough, Joe, like a sensei, yeah
Rolls Royce umbrellas when I'm in the rain
I just mind my business
I got brothers that did the time, I ain't kiddin'
All these rappers just talk about it, I live it
Goin' up, I ain't got no sky limit, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I put the new wheels on the Jeep
I worked hard till the soles on my shoes felt the heat
'Cause all my crew came up from the streets
I keep a hundred stacks inside my jeans
I remember shoppin' at the mall with the whole team

I was down, now I'm up, and they see me soaring

[Verse 1: Roddy Ricch]
All this designer on me got me lookin' fresh, ayy
Straight up from the city, I'm blessed
If I got a chance to shine, I'ma do my best
I run the game with my queen like we're on a quest
I got success on my mind, I never forget that
I had to hustle through it all, I won't ever forget that
Now I'm sittin' in the back of a ride, relaxed
They know me now 'cause I'm steady stackin' those big racks
I'm gettin' noticed, yeah, I know you've heard that
I used to be on the grind, just tryna get that
Now it's all different, it's a whole new track
And I'm movin' up now, who knew?

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I put the new wheels on the Jeep

I been waking up to get my goals, woah, woah
Got a partner, and she's got style, woah, woah
Designer on my feet, I'm reaching my peak
I upgraded my wristwatch, water flows like a creek
I was struggling, where were you then?
I know some switched up on me just to chase trends
But now they see me ridin' in the best
New jewels shining bright, no need to pretend
'Cause I've been gettin' blessed
Gold shines on me like the sunset
Got my people riding in the best set
Working for the dream, won't ever forget
I keep moving, never looking back
Focused on the grind, staying on track
Now I'm aiming high, never coming down, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I put the new wheels on the Jeep
I worked hard till the soles on my shoes felt the heat
'Cause all my crew came up from the streets

I was waking up, making plans in the morning
I was down, now I'm up, and they see me soaring

Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum

[Verse 1]
This that hot girl bummer anthem

But shit hit different when it's Thursday night

That college dropout music
Every day leg day, she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid

One more line, I'm superhuman

This that hot girl bummer two-step
They can't box me in, I'm too left
This that drip, it's more like oceans
They can't fit me in a Trojan
Out of pocket, but I'm always in my bag
Yeah, that's the slogan
This that, ""Who's all there?""
I'm pullin' up wit' a emo chick that's broken

Ayy (Ayy)
Young Metro, young Metro

[Verse 1]
Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need (Bitch need)
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down

[Chorus]
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Verse 2]
Said I'm heartless
So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket
Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit
Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit
Yeah, I got her watchin'
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now (Star)
I'm talkin' Time, Rolling Stone, and Bazaar now (Bazaar now)
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down (What?)
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now
[Chorus]
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Bridge]
I lost my heart and my mind
I try to always do right
I thought I lost you this time
You just came back in my life
You never gave up on me (Why don't you?)
I'll never know what you see (Why won't you?)
I don't do well when alone (Oh yeah)
You hear it clear in my tone

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm heartless (Ooh)
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless

English,33,Break My Heart,person,Dua Lipa,Break My Heart by Dua Lipa,"[Verse 1]
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
[Verse 2]
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
[Bridge]
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no (Oh no), I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home

English,34,Chasin' You,person,Morgan Wallen,Chasin' You by Morgan Wallen,"[Verse 1]
We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

[Chorus]
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasing' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

[Verse 2]
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio
[Chorus]
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasin' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

[Chorus]
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasin' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
If I woke up without ya, I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'til I met you
Usually, don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of keepin' me comin' back-to-back
I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex-lover, but before you leave
Usually, I would never, would never even care
But, baby, I know you're creepin', I feel it in the air

Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your

When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

Your savage lo-lo-love
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that (Your savage love)

[Verse 2: Jason Derulo]
Baby, I hope that this ain't karma 'cause I get around
You wanna run it up, I wanna lock it down
Usually, don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of makin' me spend up all my cash

Pretty lil' thing, you got a bag and now you wildin'
You just took it off the lot, no mileage
Way they hittin' you, the DM lookin' violent
Talkin' wild, you come around and now they silent
Flew the coop at seventeen, no guidance
You be stayin' low, but you know what the vibes is

My mama doesn't trust him (My oh my)
He's only here for one thing, but (So am I)

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
Yeah, a little bit older, a black leather jacket
A bad reputation, insatiable habits
He was onto me, one look and I couldn't breathe, yeah
I said, if he kissed me, I might let it happen (Oh)

I swear on my life that I've been a good girl (Oh)
Tonight, I don't wanna be her

Look, I'm the type to make her turn on her daddy (Oh yeah)
DaBaby make her forget what she learned from her daddy
I don't be tripping on lil' shawty, I let her do whatever she please
I don't be kissing on lil' shawty, she don't be kissing on me either
She came with you, then left with me
I went up a point, let's call it even (Yeah, yeah)
Don't like the car she in, gon' end up buyin' her a new Bimmer (Let's go)
That girl know what she want, she make me take it off when she see me (Let's go)
She say I make her wet whenever my face pop up on TV
I had to say, ""No disrespect, gotta do it safe or you can keep it""
Pop star, I'm fresh up out the trap and I'm going Bieber
She know I'm a call away, she can drop a pin and I'd come meet her
Stand next to me, you gon' end up catchin' a fever (Yeah, yeah)
I'm hot

I swear on my life that I've been a good girl (Good girl, good girl)
Tonight, I don't wanna be her

Woah, woah
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
[Verse 2: Lil Durk & Drake]
I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 3: Drake]
When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?",,2020,"R&B

English,42,Woah,person,Lil Baby,Woah by Lil Baby,"[Intro]
New car very noisy
Come through and it's roarin'
Yeah, yeah
You know how I'm coming
You know how I'm coming

[Verse 1]
Bend her over, then I murk her
Call Gunna if you want you a Birkin
""Oh, Baby, you be lyin' in your verses
I be hearin', say you buyin' 'em purses""
I can't even lie, you ain't my type
You ain't even all that fine in person
I can guarantee you if you my kind
She got every bag you can imagine
Big house, I can really be braggin'
Hundred thousand in my mouth like, ""What's happenin'?""
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'
He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons
My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em
Giving looks, I contribute to fashion
Drop a song, I be giving them captions
Stand alone, not your regular rapper
[Chorus]
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect
Work hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, woah
Yeah, none of you guys get fly as me, woah
Matter of fact, none of you guys get high as me, woah
Post my drip up daily just so they can see, woah
Turn me up some more so my haters can hear it, woah (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I put the dope in the back of the car and I tell 'em to go
She hit when she land, she bring me the bands, she back on the road
She know how I get when I get in that mode
Ain't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes
Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions
I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit
I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit
I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit
Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit
I'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope it
I know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless
If you tell 'em what was said, you a rodent
Drive the new Corvette like it's stolen, yeah
[Chorus]
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect

Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

[Verse 1: Powfu]
Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

[Chorus: beabadoobee, Powfu, beabadoobee & Powfu]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Yeah, ayy)
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Ayy, yeah)
[Verse 2: Powfu]
I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

[Chorus: beabadoobee, Powfu, beabadoobee & Powfu]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

I got room in my fumes (Yeah)
She fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room (It’s lit)
Hope I make it outta here (Let's go)

Got the fastest car, it zoom (Skrrt)

Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side (Yeah)

English,46,Bad Guy,person,Billie Eilish,Bad Guy by Billie Eilish,"[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

Somehow, I always end up feelin' bad
Baby, I am not your dad

Girl, it's obvious, elephant in the room
And we're a part of it, don't act so confused
And you love startin' it, now I'm in a mood

[Verse 2: 24kGoldn]
So why you tryna feign your love on the regular
When you could be blowin' up just like my cellular?
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough
I'm talkin' slick back, kick back, gang sippin' forties
You keep playin', not another day with you, shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well, you better save it for me
[Pre-Chorus: iann dior, iann dior & 24kGoldn]

We been here before and I won't be a victim

If I call you bae, you bae for the day

I'm rich but I'm ridin', I'm low on exotic, I'm 'bout to fly out and go get me some
Nothin' ain't seen, all this money on me, hunnid racks in the bag, that's a honey bun
Baby OG, I been runnin' these streets, got the game from Lashawn, I'm my mama's son
Learned 'bout the triple cross when I was young and I know I ain't goin' so I keep a gun
I flew to Paris just to buy some Dior

Park the Porsche then pull up in a Lambo (Hmph)

Look, uh, look

[Chorus]
Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice ’cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me

[Verse]
While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
""I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier""
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin’ one day I’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin’ not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah

[Chorus]
Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice 'cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me

English,52,Nobody But You,feat,Blake Shelton Duet With Gwen Stefani,Nobody But You by Blake Shelton Duet With Gwen Stefani,"[Verse 1: Blake Shelton, Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
Don't have to leave this town to see the world
'Cause it's something that I gotta do
I don't wanna look back in 30 years
And wonder who you're married to
Wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear
When you love someone, they say you set 'em free
But that ain't gonna work for me

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
Lookin' in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
You

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
All the wasted days, all the wasted nights
I blame it all on being young
Got no regrets 'cause it got me here
But I don't wanna waste another one
I been thinkin' about what I want in my life
It begins and ends the same
If I had to choose what I couldn't lose
There'd only be one thing
[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani, Gwen Stefani]
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
Lookin' in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
You
I don't wanna love nobody but you (You)

[Bridge: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
I wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani]
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me (Next to me)
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you (I don't wanna love nobody)
Lookin' in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
You
I don't wanna love nobody but you (You)

I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm lookin' up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees, spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me

[Chorus]
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved (So loved)

[Verse 2]
I've been havin' dreams
Splashin' in the summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice
Crushin' weight of paradise
Solid block of gold, lyin' in the cold
I feel right at home
[Chorus]
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved

[Bridge]
I never feel so loved
La, la-la, la-la

[Verse 1]
I try to be everything that I can
But sometimes, I come out as bein' nothin’
I try to be everything that I can
But sometimes, I come out as bein' nothin'
I pray to God that He make me a better man (Uh)
Maybe one day, I’ma stand for somethin'
I'm thankin' God that He made you part of the plan
I guess I ain't go through all that Hell for nothin'
I'm always fuckin' up and wreckin’ shit
It seems like I perfected it
I offer you my love
I hope you take it like some medicine
Tell me ain’t nobody better than me
I think that there's better than me
Hope you see the better in me
Always end up betterin’ me

We take drugs, then you hold me close
Then I tell you how you make me whole
Sometimes, I feel you like bein' alone
Then you tell me that I shoulda stayed in the room
Guess I got it all wrong all along, my fault
My mistakes probably wipe all the rights I've done
Sayin' goodbye to bygones, those are bygones
Head up, baby, stay strong, we gon' live long

Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
Woo!

I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back

Why men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting (With the bomb lighting)
New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, ""Shoot your shot"" when you see him
It's okay, he already in my DMs
[Chorus]
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting (With the bomb lighting)
New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
I'ma hit you back in a minute (Yeah, yeah)
I don't play tag, bitch, I been it (One time)
We don't fuck with lies (Two times), we don't do goodbyes (Woo)
We just keep it pushing like ay-ay-ay
I'ma hit you back in a minute (Yeah, yeah)
I don't play tag, bitch, I been it (One time)
We don't fuck with lies (Two times), we don't do goodbyes (Woo)
We just keep it pushing like ay-ay-ay (Woo)

[Chorus]
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)

English,56,If The World Was Ending,feat,JP Saxe Featuring Julia Michaels,If The World Was Ending by JP Saxe Featuring Julia Michaels,"[Verse 1: JP Saxe]
I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

[Pre-Chorus: JP Saxe]
I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

[Chorus: JP Saxe]
But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]
I tried to imagine your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen
Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

[Pre-Chorus: JP Saxe & Julia Michaels, Julia Michaels]
And I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

[Chorus: JP Saxe & Julia Michaels]
But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
Sky'd be falling while I hold you tight
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over, right?
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?
Mm
[Pre-Chorus: JP Saxe]
I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

[Chorus: JP Saxe & Julia Michaels]
But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling while I hold you tight
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?

[Verse 1: 42 Dugg]
'Fore I go broke like Joc
Fuck with that dog like Vick (Roof)
Not that rock, that pit'
Palm Angels down to my sock
Can't hold my Glock, reason I don't really like that shit (Nigga, I don't)
Young turnt nigga, can't wife no bitch (At all)
Excuse my French, don't like no bitch (Nope)
Limo tinted, all five of my cars, yeah, I had it hard
Seen my bitch broke bad, I ain't had a heart
Skrrt, yeah, that's us
Two-tone AP, yeah, I'm bust
Got the head from her, I ain't even wanna fuck (Fuck her)
Why? Slut, bye (Fuck on)
Nothin' on me from Saks, everything Revive
Old nigga tellin' on bro, should've died
No, he ain't kill 'em, dawg, he ain't even try
Still'll bet my last shootin' dice in the hood
Take who chain? Nah bitch, not Dugg's
Probably in somethin' fast with a Glock in the hood
Courtside tickets, spillin' Wock' on the wood
[Chorus: 42 Dugg & Lil Baby]
First turnt nigga from the hood, they curious
Four in cars, 'bout five in jewelry
I get the commas with numbers, that's period
I got your BM wan' put on Amiris
First young nigga in the A with two Lams
Run up fourteen mil', started fourteen grams (Same day)
Dope boy Dickies and diamonds and Timbs
You shouldn't play with that boy, he is not one of them
Bro, I kept taking L's, finally got me a M
Still making double, I don't count what I spend
S550 2018
Gotta come twenty if you hoppin' in the Benz
Young turnt nigga from the D to the A
I'm rockin' with the Lions, yeah, I'm rocking with the Braves
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we paid
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we paid

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn it up a lil' more this time
Used to dream about gettin' it, now I got it, I don't drive
I had a spot like The Varsity, what'll you have?
You buy twenty, I'll front what you buy
I put on drip, I believe I can I fly
Niggas know that I'm rich, but they know not to try
I had a show in Detroit and I stopped at Revive
And spent fifty on all of the guys
All of these hoes in these stores make commission
And plus I'ma tip 'em, they holdin' my size
Get in your car and just put on your flashers
And follow the hearse since you say you gon' ride
'Cause somebody gon' die if they fuck with us
Turn a five to a dime, that's a double up
Fuck around, walk through church with my double cup
This shit a habit, I'm prayin' I give it up
Tiger stay with the wood, make 'em give it up
Know I ran through a mil' every week coppin' weed
Bruh beat the charge, I can get me some sleep
Got a backend to pick up, I won't even leave
Run it up, fuck around, give the 'Vette to DT
Keep a hotboy with me, I got love for BG
Chasin' this paper since twelve or thirteen
Runnin' 'round in these streets, it was me and Marquise

English,59,One Man Band,band,Old Dominion,One Man Band by Old Dominion,"[Verse 1]
Been flyin' solo for so long
Nobody's singin' the harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No bass, no guitar, no tambourine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I found you like a melody
You were singin' in the same key as me
We had ‘em dancin' in the streets

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
I don't wanna be a one man band
No

[Verse 2]
I wanna run down your wild dreams
And I wanna chase every high with you
Count every rip in these old jeans
We'll never learn how to sing the blues
[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I'm gonna be famous
Girl, I wanna be famous with you
We got our own little groove

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band

[Bridge]
When the spotlight goes cold, and the curtains come down
The chairs are all stacked, and there's no one around
And nobody's payin', we’ll still be playin'

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand

Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Yeah, ayy, ayy)

It's gonna get difficult to stand, but hold your balance
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it 'cause

But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh-huh, uh
It's okay, it's okay

[Chorus: Forrest]
Ayy, feeling good like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Ayy)
[Verse 2: Forrest]
Some days you wake up and nothing works, you feel surrounded
Gotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded
Keep good things inside your ears just like the waves and sound did
And just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it

[Pre-Chorus: Forrest]
Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh-huh, uh
It's okay, it's okay

[Chorus: Forrest]
Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
Ayy, feeling good, like I should

English,62,Godzilla,feat,Eminem Featuring Juice WRLD,Godzilla by Eminem Featuring Juice WRLD,"[Intro]
Ugh, you're a monster

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Eminem]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Eminem]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
[Verse 3: Eminem]
If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—

Girls just wanna have fun
So they party, so they party
(Ayy, yo, Nashi, you goin' crazy)

[Chorus]
Lil' mama a party girl, she just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type, but I don't care, I want you
She like to do drugs too, she in love with guns too
They say you too piped up, but I think that I love you
Lil' mama a party girl, she just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type, but I don't care, I want you
She like to do drugs too, she in love with guns too
They say you too piped up, but I think that I love you

[Verse]
She don't want nobody, she don't need somebody
I'm tryna be with you so you don't be without me
She totin' just like me, no, we can't leave without it
She boot up off the meds like she can't breathe without it
She drinkin' Four Lokos, I can't get with those
She wan' give me toto, I tell her come close
She say, ""You say you love me, but I don't know what love means""
I ask her who got her heart, 'cause damn, that nigga lucky
I been tryna reach for it, but it's too far above me
I ain't never do you wrong, so tell me why you don't trust me
She don't do this often, she said it's only because me
You the one who want it, therefore you can never judge me
She just wanna party and nothing's wrong with that
Every time I'm calling, she say she gon' call me back
I told her call me Rocky, she say she not gon' call me that
You say you come with a lot, well, baby, I want all of that
[Chorus]
Lil' mama a party girl, she just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type, but I don't care, I want you
She like to do drugs too, she in love with guns too
They say you too piped up, but I think that I love you
Lil' mama a party girl, she just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type, but I don't care, I want you
She like to do drugs too, she in love with guns too
They say you too piped up, but I think that I love you

Hey mama, how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress?
Black mascara off a pillowcase?
Cure a one-too-many headache?
Mama, can I come and maybe stay a few days
This weekend or next?
And hey, how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress?

[Chorus: Both]
How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?

[Verse 2: Both, Maddie]
Can you ask Daddy if he's got time
To come and look at my front door?
It got slammed last night
And now it don't close right
And just promise that you won't tell him everything
And keep that pistol in the drawer
Mama, please don't say
I'm gonna laugh about this someday
You didn't see the way he drove away
[Chorus: Both]
How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?
Oh, a broken heart

[Bridge: Maddie, Tae, Both]
Can your knees give out from prayin' so hard? (Prayin' so hard)
Can you go blind from crying in the dark? (In the dark)
Was it ever really real
If he don't feel like I feel?

[Chorus: Both, Maddie]
How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus]
I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you

Are you one of them girls that peels off the Bud Light label? Just might run a pool table?
Roll your eyes if I call you an angel, ain't you one of them girls?
Ask you to dance, you say ""No"" just to see how far I'll go
Your song comes on and your eyes close, that's when I know, yeah
You got your heart on lock down, got a wall I gotta knock down
Kinda wanna do a shot now, come on now

And you're one of them girls that ain't tryna meet nobody

If you're one of them girls, 'cause I'm one of them boys
Would trade his whole world, hm, yeah
For one of them girls who likes to act all quiet, sexy, not even tryin'

You one of them girls, broke every heart in your hometown
On the day you rode out, got 'em all wishin' on stars now

There stands the glass
That will ease all my pain
That will settle my brain
It's my first one today
There stands the glass
That-that will ease all my pain
That-that will settle my brain
It's-it's my first one today

[Verse 1]
Ayy
I saw your sister at work
I saw your mama at church
I'm pretty sure I saw your car at the mall
I see your face in the clouds
I smell your perfume in crowds
I swear your number's all my phone wants to call

[Pre-Chorus]
It's kinda funny how I can't seem
To get away from you
It's almost like you don't want me to

[Chorus]
You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight, out of mind
Girl, you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget
[Verse 2]
Told me to leave all your things
Out on the porch, on the swing
You'd come and grab 'em by the end of the week
Well, it's just some jeans and a shirt
But it's a whole lot of hurt
I think I know why you've been dragging your feet

Ain't it funny how I can't seem
To get away from you?
It's almost like you don't want me to

But we're here doin' our thing
Lettin' go a little, little by little
Sippin' on a frozen drink

[Pre-Chorus]
Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, it goes like

[Chorus]
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
""Hey, señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Buffett song?""
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone

[Verse 2]
Ice blue skies, shades on the eyes
To tuck the bloodshot away
Hair of the dog, shouldn't take long
But who cares, we got all day
Palm trees a-leanin', sunburn screamin'
But we'll all be alright, after
[Chorus]
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
""Hey, señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Marley song?""
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone

[Post-Chorus]
We'll be gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, feelin' no pain
It goes like

[Chorus]
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way

D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wanting them to see me? I

[Refrain]
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

[Chorus]
Just say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me

[Verse 2]
Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny now?
Now they need me, number one on streaming
Oh yeah, you used to love me
So what happened, what's the meaning? I
[Refrain]
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

[Verse 3]
Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan
But I still want you as a fan
I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands
But I need you to...

[Chorus]
Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me

Wheezy outta here

Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Cartier eye
I'm the bossman in a suit but no tie
I can't be sober, I gotta stay high
Pour me some syrup in a Canada Dry
Ridin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't worry, baby, I keep me some fire
Shenenehs and Birkins, she cannot decide
The latest Mercedes her go-to surprise
Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize
Dick in her back while I'm grippin' her sides
Bigger Maybach, this ain't regular size
We really fly, we like pelican glide
Bitch, you ain't slick, I can tell the disguise
Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky
She sing, I might sign her and change her whole life
I told her to gargle and work on her highs
[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Interlude: Young Thug]
Cash, money, checks, cash
Addy, Birkin, brand new extendos
I just wanna fuck the bitch by myself
I just passed her to the dawg like my Sprite

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I took the Bentley coupe back, then I hopped in a Cayenne (Skrrt)
I put the bitch in the front of the Bentley, in front of the driver (Skrrt)
Ayy, man, this synthetic weed, you can't smoke in the Rolls Royce, woah, woah (Yeah, yeah)
I'm still double cupped up, I'm drinkin', I shoot off your tires, huh (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
I'm in the coupe by myself
I had to kick a door when I was 5
Keep the awards on the shelf
Whole sixteen round in the fire
I'm sick and tired of these young niggas act like they firin', they tellin' these lies
Actin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys
Yeah, Cartier eyes
Cartier coat, Cartiers the watch
Cartier love, Cartier the thot
Cartier specs, buffalo on the side
Princess cut diamonds, they Cartier, yeah
Cartier bag for the Cartier thot
Sky Wrangler coupe with two hundred the dash
Cartier jeans, ain't no way I can sag
Ain't no way I'ma ever gon' go out bad
I can't go out, no way I'ma go out
I just grip on her ass and I show out
I sit like a champ and I wait on a hold-out
I just whip up a new Chanel Patek
I whip with the wrist and I don't break the door out
Turn the whole top floor to a whorehouse
Hundred racks in ones, dude brought the flood out

It's all on me, it's my mistake
I said I don't love you a little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a goodbye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better

[Chorus: Both, Carly Pearce]
I hope you find what you were lookin' for
I hope your heart ain't hurtin' anymore
And you get movin' on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now

[Verse 2: Lee Brice, Both]
Who knew this heart could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warnin'
I thought that I was what you wanted

[Chorus: Both, Lee Brice]
Well, I guess you found what you were lookin' for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothin' left
And so I hope you're happy now
[Chorus: Both, Carly Pearce, Lee Brice]
I hope you find what you were lookin' for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
Hope you get movin' on, all figured out

English,74,Emotionally Scarred,person,Lil Baby,Emotionally Scarred by Lil Baby,"[Verse 1]
A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah
[Chorus]
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

[Verse 2]
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it
[Chorus]
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry

Suicidal
Your love is suicidal
Lately I've been feeling suicidal
Your love is suicidal

[Pre-Chorus: YNW Melly]
I thought that we were meant to be
You took my heart and made it bleed
I gave you all my ecstasy
I know you'll be the death of me (Keep it Z3N)
Left lipstick on my Hennessy
Felt like you took my soul from me
You gave me all your ecstasy
I thought that we were meant to be

[Chorus: YNW Melly & Juice WRLD, Both]
Your love is suicidal
For me, your love is suicidal
To me, your love is suicidal (Ooh)
To me, your love is suicidal

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Sippin' on this Hennessy, once you were my friend
Now you turned into my enemy, here we go again
I think love is just like money how it blows in the wind
Got me taking medicine, these is not no vitamins
I thought that we were meant to be
'Til you struck out like one, two, three
The thought of you was heavenly
At first, now it's where Hell will be
Oh, I've been balling on my own, shawty, sipping fours
Pour it in a twenty, make it strong, shawty, gripping poles
Catch your new lil' nigga and it's on, shawty, I'ma blow
Hit him with the Ruger and it's too silent, make it go (Shh)
Do him bogus, make his heart hurt, that's what love is
You're leaving me for him, are you on drugs, bitch?
I know you are, 'cause you're never Perc'-less, so perfect
[Pre-Chorus: YNW Melly]
I thought that we were meant to be
You took my heart and made it bleed
I gave you all my ecstasy
I know you'll be the death of me
Left lipstick on my Hennessy
Felt like you took my soul from me
You gave me all your ecstasy
I thought that we were meant to be

[Chorus: YNW Melly & Juice WRLD, Both]
Your love is suicidal
For me, your love is suicidal
To me, your love is suicidal (Ooh)
To me, your love is suicidal

[Verse 2: YNW Melly]
I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y, ooh
I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y, ooh
I don't wanna lose my conscience
Drinkin' all this Hennessy
But, baby, you took control of me
And I got too many enemies
I knew you wanted to fuck him 'cause I could tell

[Chorus: YNW Melly & Juice WRLD, Both]
Your love is suicidal
For me, your love is suicidal
To me, your love is suicidal (Ooh)
To me, your love is suicidal
[Outro: Juice WRLD]
Huh, ooh, I'm pissin' Hennessy-'y-'y, ooh
Then flush it in the past, then fornicate with cash
I'm tryna heal the gash, you up and made a slash, then left (Ooh)
You tell your friends I was the worst even though it isn't true
You actin' out your body, baby, I know it isn't you
Seen you feel ridiculed when you played me like a fool",,2020,"Rap

English,76,The Bigger Picture,person,Lil Baby,The Bigger Picture by Lil Baby,"[Intro]
Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd (Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

[Verse 1]
Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather
[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names
[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

[Verse 3]
They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah
[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere

English,79,Sum 2 Prove,person,Lil Baby,Sum 2 Prove by Lil Baby,"[Verse 1]
You know Lil Ced, that's my nigga, I made him a millionaire, fuck it, we all rich
I ain't tryna have babies right now, so we fuck with the rubber, but I got a raw bitch
Know this money bring envy, you probably wan' be me, but bro, we can't beef 'bout no small shit
Overseas, got the crowd doin' moshpits
Can't believe that I'm still in the 'partments
Businessman, went and got me an office
Million-dollar deals, I get 'em often
Me and Dolla was servin' on Sparks Street
Hot lil' jit, he gon' stay with the chopstick
I got robbed, that shit made me a monster
Eviction notice, my sister, my mamas
Now they houses as big as they want 'em
I done ran up them motherfuckin' commas, look at lil' Dominique
Livin' like we in a race, I might come in first or second, but I won't ever be last
Lately, I been in my bag
Bro told me don't take my foot off the gas
If they give you a inch, go'n and take you a mile
I'ma shoot by myself like a technical foul
City to city, got girls goin' wild
Better not reach for my chain when I jump in the crowd
Lambo' so low, gotta squat
We finally made it, let's pop us some bottles
I took the lead and let everyone follow
They know I'm runnin' it right to the bank
They want me to ease up, I didn't leave 'em any breathin' room, sorry, I told 'em, ""I can't""
Heard you a rat, so you know what's gon' happen whenever we catch you, I run with them snakes
Peep all the moves I been makin', by time I get forty, I gotta be one of them greats
Watch how I move with this paper, I know if I slip up one time they gon' try to come take it
Real as it get and these niggas be fakin', I don't want they vibes, so they hand I ain't shakin'
She on that '42 straight with no chaser
I'm tryna get out of here and go taste her, yeah
[Chorus]
Yeah, my diamonds be VV's (VV's)
They don't wan' see us on TV unless it's the news
I got somethin' to prove (Somethin' to prove)
Yeah, I'm young, but got somethin' to lose (Somethin' to lose)
In the street, I done paid all my dues (Yeah)
No extortion, ain't talking 'bout literally (Nah)
I be walkin' on beats, is you hearin' me? (Huh?)
I just pray that my kids be a bigger me, they can't get rid of me
My diamonds be VV's (VV's)
They don't wan' see us on TV unless it's the news
I got somethin' to prove (Somethin' to prove)
Yeah, I'm young, but got somethin' to lose (Somethin' to lose)
In the street, I done paid all my dues (Yeah)
No extortion, ain't talking 'bout literally (Nah)
I be walkin' on beats, is you hearin' me? (Huh?)
I just pray that my kids be a bigger me, they can't get rid of me

[Verse 2]
Wake up every day, somebody harrassin' me
I got rich, they need money, they askin' me
I was sittin' in jail, they ain't look out for me
Ones who need me them same ones who doubted me
I been handlin' my own, they can vouch for me
Head way down with me, know that she proud of me
Turn the heat up, ain't nobody hot as me
Everywhere dollars be, that's how I gotta be
I done gave her the world, now she not leavin'
Say she love me to death, told her, ""Stop breathin'""
He try do what I do, but we not even
I want all of the beef, I am not vegan
Boy, you said it was smoke, nigga, stop speakin'
'Ventador, drop the top, I can't stop speedin'
Tryna see if this bitch hit the top speed
Hit the bitch from the back, have her knock knee
Call me Baby Hov, I control the rock
If the rap slow, I control the block
Yeah, I'm really it, and you niggas not
Got a couple coupes, I can drop the top
I done made it, nigga, all these digits comin' in
I'm savin' for the bigger picture, know one day I'll need 'em
Might as well get used to me
My biggest fear is endin' up a used-to-be, yeah
[Chorus]
Yeah, my diamonds be VV's (VV's)
They don't wan' see us on TV unless it's the news
I got somethin' to prove (Somethin' to prove)
Yeah, I'm young, but got somethin' to lose (Somethin' to lose)
In the street, I done paid all my dues (Yeah)
No extortion, ain't talking 'bout literally (Nah)
I be walkin' on beats, is you hearin' me? (Huh?)
I just pray that my kids be a bigger me, they can't get rid of me
My diamonds be VV's (VV's)
They don't wan' see us on TV unless it's the news

You know Lil Ced, that's my homie, I made him a millionaire, now we all rich
I ain't tryna have babies right now, so we play it safe, but I got a real chick
Know this money brings envy, you probably wanna be me, but bro, we can't beef 'bout no small stuff
Overseas, got the crowd doin' moshpits
Can't believe that I'm still in the 'partments
Businessman, went and got me an office
Million-dollar deals, I get 'em often
Me and Dolla was servin' on Sparks Street
Hot lil' guy, he gon' stay with the chopstick
I got robbed, that made me a monster
Eviction notice, my sister, my mama
Now they houses as big as they want 'em
I done ran up them commas, look at lil' Dominique
Livin' like we in a race, I might come in first or second, but I won’t ever be last
Lately, I been in my bag
Bro told me don’t take my foot off the gas
If they give you an inch, go and take you a mile
I’m gon' shoot by myself like a technical foul
City to city, got girls goin' wild
Better not reach for my chain when I jump in the crowd
Lambo' so low, gotta squat
We finally made it, let's pop some bottles
I took the lead and let everyone follow
They know I’m runnin' it right to the bank
They want me to ease up, I didn’t leave 'em any breathin' room, sorry, I told 'em, ""I can't""
Heard you a rat, so you know what’s gon' happen whenever we catch you, I roll with the best
Peep all the moves I been makin', by time I hit forty, I gotta be one of the greats
Watch how I move with this paper, I know if I slip up one time, they gon' try to come take it
Real as it gets and these people be fakin', I don’t want their vibes, so their hand I ain’t shakin'
She on that top-shelf, straight with no chaser
I'm tryna get out of here and go taste her, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, my diamonds be VV’s (VV’s)
They don’t wanna see us on TV unless it’s the news
I got somethin' to prove (Somethin' to prove)
Yeah, I’m young, but got somethin' to lose (Somethin' to lose)
In the street, I done paid all my dues (Yeah)
No extortion, ain’t talking 'bout literally (Nah)
I be walkin' on beats, is you hearin' me? (Huh?)
I just pray that my kids be a bigger me, they can’t get rid of me
My diamonds be VV’s (VV’s)
They don’t wanna see us on TV unless it’s the news
I got somethin' to prove (Somethin' to prove)
Yeah, I’m young, but got somethin' to lose (Somethin' to lose)
In the street, I done paid all my dues (Yeah)
No extortion, ain’t talking 'bout literally (Nah)
I be walkin' on beats, is you hearin' me? (Huh?)
I just pray that my kids be a bigger me, they can’t get rid of me

[Verse 2]
Wake up every day, somebody askin' me
I got rich, now they need money, they askin' me
I was sittin' in jail, they ain’t look out for me
Ones who need me, them same ones who doubted me
I been handlin' my own, they can vouch for me
Head way down with me, know that she proud of me
Turn the heat up, ain’t nobody hot as me
Everywhere dollars be, that’s how I gotta be
I done gave her the world, now she not leavin'",2020,"Rap

Mmm
Hey, yeah
(That's just for fun)
(What?)
(I'm stuck with you)
Ah

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I'm not one to stick around
One strike and you're out, baby
Don't care if I sound crazy
But you never let me down, no, no
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
Still layin' in your bed, singin'

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on our hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber with Ariana Grande]
There's nowhere we need to be, no, no, no
I'ma get to know you better
Kinda hope we're here forever
There's nobody on these streets
If you told me that the world's endin'
Ain't no other way that I can spend it

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber, with Ariana Grande & Both]
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Ooh)
Got all this time in my hands
Might as well cancel our plans (Yeah, yeah)
I could stay here forever

[Chorus: Justin Bieber with Ariana Grande]
So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't trade
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you

[Bridge: Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande & Both]
Woah
Baby, come take all my time
Go on, make me lose my mind
We got all that we need here tonight
[Chorus: Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber & Both]
I lock the door (Lock the door) and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more (Can't fight this no more), it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I'd rather do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
All this lovin' you, hatin' you, wantin' you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with
You, oh, oh

(Mood swings)
Oh, you ain't know I could sing? (Oh, oh, oh)
Hahaha (Yeah)

[Chorus: Pop Smoke & Lil Tjay]
Shorty a lil' baddie (She a lil' baddie)
Shorty my lil' boo thing (Boo thing)
And shorty got the fatty
Shorty be catching mood swings
Every time I fuck without a rubber
I nutted on the covers
And I kept it undercover
'Cause I don't kiss and tell (Kiss and tell)

[Verse 1: Pop Smoke & Lil Tjay]
Every time I fuck, she call me daddy
My lil' mama nasty
I see the pussy through the panties (Whatever you want)
She taste like candy
She a queen, like Nefertiti
Uh oh, my lil' mama sittin' pretty
And we be shoppin' through the city (Oh, oh)
I gave her keys to the Bentley (Woah, woah)
Get off your knees, you don't gotta cry to me
I'm your best friend, baby, you don't gotta lie
I'll get you everything that you want and you need from Chanel to Celine
It's on you to decide
Valentino, yeah, I put you in the best
Start liftin' up your dress, start kissin' on your neck (Oh no, no)
Start rubbin' on your butt, start massagin' your breasts
I ain't wanna give you a baby just yet, so I backed out and nutted on your breasts
I put you in a Uber (Uber) and sent you to your bed (Oh)
The very next day (Oh), you sent me a text (Oh)
You pulled up to the crib and we did it again (Oh, oh)

I nutted on the covers
And I kept it undercover
'Cause I don't kiss and tell (Ooh)

[Verse 2: Lil Tjay & Pop Smoke]
You know, I never found love until I looked into your eyes (Until I looked into your eyes)
First time blushin', I ain't even gon' lie (Ain't even gon' lie)
Four rounds in, leavin' bruises on your thighs
You the only bitch could make me spin off on the guys
And the only bitch that make me wanna nut when I'm inside
It's your vibe, leave with me, you gettin' high
Girl, ain't bitches fuckin' wit' you even if they tried
Pussy a tsunami, I ain't never fucked it dry
Close my eyes 'fore I sleep, hope you be there when I wake
Honestly, I feel the vibe we have is great
And if there's something in your mind, you can tell me
And if I told you what's on mine, would you help me?
You gon' see the bigger picture, it's just gon' take time
Just because you mine, I'ma keep you lookin' like a dime
Ain't no imperfections, girl, you fine
Baby, what's your sign?
I hope you ain't against the slow grind
(Work, work, it's me and you) Me and you
Keep it silent, there ain't nothin' we can't do
Through the storm, baby, we can make it through
Why you actin' brand new? You know you my lil' boo thang
Got up on my Birkin, it's workin'
She said she a virgin (It's hurtin')
She my biggest fan, she always lurkin'
And she know I'm a man, I'ma put that work in
I know she can't stand me, I'm fancy
So I'ma bring her out when I get my Grammy
Late night sex, she can't find her panties
Couldn't hold it in, now she need a plan B
[Chorus: Pop Smoke & Lil Tjay]
Shorty a lil' baddieShe my lil' boo thing

I wanna start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest (My chest)
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret (Regret)
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way

[Pre-Chorus]
No, you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so fucking far
That you would never ever touch me again
Won't see your alligator tears
'Cause know I've had enough of them
[Verse 2]
I'm gonna start this out by saying (By saying)
I really meant well from the start
Take a broken man right in my hands
And then put back all his parts

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel so sorry (I feel so sorry)
I feel so sad (I feel so sad)
I tried to help you (I tried to help you)
It just made you mad
And I had no warning (I had no warning)
About who you are (About who you are)
Just glad I made it out without breaking down
Oh, I feel so sorry (I feel so sorry)
I feel so sad (I feel so sad)
I tried to help you (I tried to help you)
It just made you mad
And I had no warning (I had no warning)
About who you are (About who you are)
'Bout who you are
[Bridge]
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

[Verse 2]
Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night

But I'll always be right there

I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye

There's no way that I can walk this road alone
Daddy grabbed my hand and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, boy, I ain't scared
I won't be here, but I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

I might be better on my own
I hate you blowin' up my phone

[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
We both wanna love
We both wanna slide
We both wanna argue until we're both right
And you want a hug
I kiss you goodnight
Maybe we're both just out of our mind (Ooh)
And you throw tantrums while I'm twistin' up
No medicine is fixin' us
Can't tell you why but tell you what
You got me thinkin'

I might be better on my own

I cross the seas wit' you (Hey, seas)
Wasn't even supposed to be wit' you (Yeah, be)
Yeah, and it gets crazy in the night
I cannot sleep with you (Sleep with you)
And I could keep you nice and warm (Ayy)
Won't do no thinking, I'm in love (Yeah, yeah)
If I was to give you the world (Yeah)
That's anything that you can think of (Of)

Sometimes, when you thought you found the love of your life (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now you're thinkin' I'm just one of those guys, leading on

You put me down, I pick you up
Can't tell you why but tell you what (You should know that)
You got me thinkin'

Dancin' in the kitchen, you singin' my favorite song
Swingin' on the front porch, just laughin' at the dogs
How you swear you love me more when you're whispering, ""Goodnight""
All those little moments are every reason why

This feelin' that I'm feeling'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it
That all I wanna do
Is be alone with
Your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin'
Onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby, that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you

Well, it says ""Kane Brown"" on a sign with a line out the door
It sold out some little town I've never been before
Yeah, they're screamin' my name, this is what we dreamed about
But out here singin' 'bout you, baby, all I'm thinkin' 'bout

And if love keeps giving me lemons

And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart

Ooh

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm a giver
Yeah, and I'm still giving 'em hell
Forgiving's pretty hard
So I made an art out of forgettin' 'em well
Yeah, I'm a rhymer
I can turn 20 cents into a 10
And if I get confused and I start to lose
I rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense

[Chorus]
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I turn a light on in my soul
And keep a bluebird in my heart

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh

[Chorus]
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love starts giving me lemons
Just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
Keep a bluebird in my heart

I can't breathe (Chopsquad), I can't breathe, 999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well

[Chorus]
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

[Verse 1]
Ring-ring, phone call from depression
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line, I talk to addiction, huh
Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them
This can't be real, is it fiction?
Somethin' feels broke, need to fix it
I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished
[Pre-Chorus]
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

[Chorus]
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Let's be for real
If it wasn't for the pills, I wouldn't be here
But if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah
I just told y'all my secret, yeah
It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me
[Pre-Chorus]
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em

English,93,Does To Me,feat,Luke Combs Featuring Eric Church,Does To Me by Luke Combs Featuring Eric Church,"[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Bridge: Eric Church]
There's a worn-out blade that my granddaddy gave me
My mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs & Eric Church]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe (Average Joe)
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe (For what I believe)
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Yeah, it does to me
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

English,96,More Than My Hometown,person,Morgan Wallen,More Than My Hometown by Morgan Wallen,"[Verse 1]
Girl, our mamas are best friends and so are we
The whole town's rooting for us like the home team
Most likely to settle down
Plant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know

[Chorus]
That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

[Verse 2]
I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that
[Chorus]
I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls around, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

[Bridge]
Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But that ain't you and me so I guess I'll see you around
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown
[Outro]
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more, baby, love you more",,2020,"Country

Don't get me wrong
I like a bobber on the water
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I like a Friday night slow ride
Brooks & Dunn B-side
Hit rewind, spin it again
I like a strong shot of whiskey
The way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken in cowboy boots

[Chorus]
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you

Birdie on a par 5
Miller Lite before noon
I like a two-door old Ford
Wood board back porch
Three chords and the truth

I shot a shot at my nigga bitch, really didn't think before I did it (No)
Make it make sense (Please)
Luckily, I was on point with the last ho, kept my receipts (Why?)
Warranty good, made sure I got a full refund when I gave her back to the streets (Go)
Forever I rep, put the set on the chain
I'm thuggin', you already know how I came (Know how)
Yeah, he got money, but niggas be lame

Her mani and pedi same color my teeth (White)
She got a blue check and a check without me (Nice)
Hood nigga ridin' in a foreign on E (Still)
Sick of these niggas, COVID-19 (Ugh)
Karate'd the Wocky, tryna kick the cup (Shake it)
Came up like Giannis, I get bigger bucks (Made it)
Got four different choppers, right there in this truck (Now)
I'm just being honest, I could get you touched (Brr)
Put you in the blender, I could get you slushed (Haha)

I know it's hurtin', she salty, I scarred her
Beware what you lay up and say to these bitches, they can't hold water (Period)

I thought a nigga who watch what I do
But he can't get his bitch back said somethin' (Tough)

Probably, I don't put that past him (Maybe so)
I thought a ho that be speakin' on me
But be fuckin' a broke nigga said somethin' (Listen)
Hol' up, lil' bitch, get a nigga that's lit

Confident, I'm not cocky, so get it right
She bendin' over, but I want some head first
I don't even wanna know what the pussy like
Trippin' too close to fallin', so I'm ballin'
It's crazy, my opp got shot but I ain't call it (Sike, slow up)
I come around, niggas gon' put they ho up
These bitches stay on my channel, yeah
Must've seen me on TV, yeah
It took me six hours to count a mil' exactly, I'm accurate with the cheese, yeah (Big Bagg)
[Chorus]
Huh? (What?)
Ah, I thought a broke nigga said somethin' (Ah)
Talkin' shit, but they still ain't sayin' nothin' (Ain't sayin' nothin')

[Verse 1]
Hundreds and fifties, can’t swap a dime for a penny
You know that's a foolish decision (Yup)
Headfirst with it
I took a chance with my friend’s girl, didn’t think before I did it (No)
Make it make sense (Please)
Luckily, I was on point with the last one, kept my receipts (Why?)
Warranty good, made sure I got a full refund when I gave her back to the streets (Go)
Forever I rep, put the crew on the chain
I'm hustling, you already know how I came (Know how)
Yeah, he got money, but people be lame
I upgraded her life, told her, ""Get out that Range""
Her nails and toes same color as my teeth (White)
She got a blue check and a check without me (Nice)
Hood guy ridin' in a foreign on E (Still)
Sick of these folks, COVID-19 (Ugh)
Switched up my habits, tryna kick the cup (Shake it)
Came up like Giannis, I get bigger bucks (Made it)
Got four different rides, right there in this truck (Now)
I'm just being honest, I could get you touched (Brr)
Put you in a twist, I could get you slushed (Haha)
I see the comments but really unbothered
I know it’s hurtin', she salty, I scarred her
Beware what you lay up and say to these folks, they can’t hold water (Period)

[Chorus]
Ah, I thought a broke person said something (Ah)
Talkin' noise, but they still ain't sayin' nothing (Ain't sayin' nothing)

But be dating a broke guy said something (Listen)
Hold up, lil' buddy, get a person that’s lit

I ain't messing with 'em (Nope)

Supposed to be smell-proof, busting out the vacuum seal

Confident, I'm not cocky, so get it right
She bending over, but I want some talk first
I don't even wanna know what the vibe's like
Tripping too close to falling, so I'm balling

You always wearin' them glasses
You don't wanna let no sucker look you in your eyes, huh?
Better show off them eyelashes
You love what you do with a passion
Ooh, that shit attractive

[Verse 1: H.E.R.]
All he wanna do is gas me
How we end up in the backseat?
Just tryna get to the bag
We on the same page, you the same way
Only keep the fam around me
So let me know what it's gon' be
I don't plan on gettin' no sleep, while we

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
Doin' our thing, movin' too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon' say?
With the top down screamin', ""Money ain't a thing""
And we up 'til six in the mornin'
When the sun rise, we be on it
Ooh, I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon' slide?
Baby, when we gon' slide? Hey, hey
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Oh, yeah, yeah
Baby when we gon' slide, slide, slide, slide?
Slide, uh
[Verse 2: H.E.R.]
I don't care if we on the run
Nothin' matters when we one on one
Lookin' at us 'cause we goin' dumb
We on the same wave, you the same way
You know I be down if it's with you
Where we goin'? Baby, what's the move?
We should take a trip up to the moon
Get a room

I'm on a mission, but we far out
This city talkin' with a large mouth
Yeah, they after the boy like Fall Out (4Hunnid)
Drop it, give me fifty, girl, drop it, give me fifty
You should slide with me 'cause you be trippin' when you miss me
You gon' hold me close and on your neck gon' be a hickie
I ain't gotta do too much, I know what get you sticky
I ain't gotta know astrology, I know your vibe
Skip the foreplay, you don't let niggas fuck with your mind
I ain't givin' out apologies when I'm behind
Fuckin' up the seats of the brand new ride

[Chorus: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more (Kio, Kio)

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
[Verse 2: Lil Nas X]
Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]

I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Verse 3: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more
[Chorus: Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (Ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh)
Ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Needless to say, I keep in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (Yeah)
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (Wreck)
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (Wreck)
Needless to say, I'm keeping in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're a sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower
[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Every time I'm leavin' on ya (Ooh)
You don't make it easy, no (No, no)
Wish I could be there for ya (Ooh)
Give me a reason to, oh (Oh)
Every time I'm walkin' out (Oh)
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around (Oh, oh)
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down (No)
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (Now)
I know you're scared of the unknown (Known)
You don't wanna be alone (Alone)
I know I always come and go (And go)
But it's out of my control

[Chorus: Post Malone]
And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower (Yeah)",,2019,"Rap

English,3,Without Me,person,Halsey,Without Me by Halsey,"[Verse 1]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2]
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just runnin' from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

[Pre-Chorus]
Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah
[Bridge]
You don't have to say just what you did (What you did)
I already know (I know)
I had to go and find out from them (Oh-woah)
So tell me, how's it feel? (Oh-woah)

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)",,2019,"R&B

English,4,Bad Guy,person,Billie Eilish,Bad Guy by Billie Eilish,"[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

English,6,Happier,feat,Marshmello & Bastille,Happier by Marshmello & Bastille,"[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Bridge]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all of 'em""
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms
[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, ""Put it in the bag,"" yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah
[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)",,2019,"Rap

Astro, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Sun is down, freezin' cold
That's how we already know, winter's here

That's just all he know, he don't know nothin' else
I tried to show 'em, yeah

(Woo) Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose
[Refrain: Big Hawk & Swae Lee]
Some-some-some-someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-play-playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (Someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-play-playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak

[Verse 3: Travis Scott & Uncle Luke]
Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

High, high hopes

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

[Verse 1]
Mama said, ""Fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything""
Mama said, ""Burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything""

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said ""Don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting""
[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

[Verse 2]
Mama said, ""It's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders, ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything"" (High, high hopes)
""Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down""

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said ""Don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh""
[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living

Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, ""Thank you"" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad

Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
Woo!

[Verse 1]
I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back

[Chorus]
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair

New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, ""Shoot your shot"" when you see him
It's okay, he already in my DMs

I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, ""Shall we dance?"" (Hell, yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that

Who wants to fit in anyway?

I can deal with the bad nights

We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back

But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that

English,17,Eastside,feat,"benny blanco, Halsey & Khalid","Eastside by benny blanco, Halsey & Khalid","[Intro: Khalid]
Uh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Khalid]
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
[Verse 2: Halsey]
Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

[Chorus: Halsey & Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
[Bridge: Halsey & Khalid]
Run away now, run away now
Run away now
Run away now, run away now
Run away now

[Outro: Halsey & Khalid]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside

English,18,Going Bad,feat,Meek Mill Featuring Drake,Going Bad by Meek Mill Featuring Drake,"[Intro: Drake & Future]
Yeah
(Wheezy outta here)
Jeez, jeez

[Verse 1: Drake]
Back home, smokin' legal (Legal)
I got more slaps than The Beatles (Beatles)
Foreign shit runnin' on diesel, dawg
Playin' with my name, that shit is lethal, dawg (Who you say you was?)
Don Corleone
Trust me, at the top it isn't lonely (Strapped)
Everybody actin' like they know me, dawg
Don't just say you're down, you gotta show me (What you gotta do?)
Bring the clip back empty (It's empty)
You asked to see the boss, so they sent me, dawg (Sent me, dawg)
I just broke her off with a 10-piece, dawg (10-piece, dawg)
That ain't nothin', I'm just bein' friendly, dawg

[Chorus: Drake]
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day
[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, lot of Murakami in the hallway (What?)
Got a sticky and I keep it at my dawg's place
Girl, I left your love at Magic, now it's all shade
Still goin' bad on you anyway

[Interlude: Meek Mill]
Woah, woah, ooh, woah
Woah, woah, ah

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I could fit like 80 racks in my Amiris (80 racks)
Me and Drizzy back-to-back, it's gettin' scary (Back-to-back)
If you fuckin' with my opps, just don't come near me (Get outta my way)
Put some bands all on your head like Jason Terry (Brrt, brrt, ooh)
Richard Mille cost a Lambo (That's a Lambo)
Known to keep the baddest bitches on commando (Salute)
Every time I'm in my trap, I move like Rambo (Extended)
Ain't a neighborhood in Philly that I can't go (That's a Fendi)
For real
She said, ""Oh, you rich rich?"" (""You rich rich"")
Bitch, I graduated, call me ""Big Fish"" (Marlin)
I got Lori Harvey on my wish list (That's Lori)
That's the only thing I want for Christmas (True story, uh)
I've been had my way out here, yeah, know that's facts (Facts)
You ain't livin' that shit you say, yeah, we know that's cap (That's cap)
You ain't got to ask me when you see me, know I'm strapped (Brrt)
DC, OVO, we back again, we goin' plat' (Ooh, ooh)
[Chorus: Drake]
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away

English,19,Shallow,feat,Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper,Shallow by Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper,"[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times, I find myself longin'
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

Better
Nothing, baby
Nothing feels better
I'm not really drunk, I never get that fucked up
I'm not, I'm so sober

[Verse 1]
Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
(Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are)
I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark
(I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark)
No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored
(No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored)
'Cause I live down the street
So we meet when you need and it's yours
All I hear is...

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I'll admit
Nothing feels better than this
[Verse 2]
You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around
(You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around)
You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?
(You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?)
'Cause I am
I got so high the other night, I swear to God, felt my feet lift the ground
(I got so high the other night, I swear to God I felt my feet lift the ground)
Ooh, yeah
Your back against the wall, this is all you've been talking about
In my ears

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit
Nothing feels better than this

[Bridge]
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like
[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit
Nothing feels better than this (Better than this)

Oh, she's sweet but a psycho

She'll make you curse, but she a blessin'
She'll rip your shirt within a second
You'll be comin' back, back for seconds
With your plate, you just can't help it

Yeah, people say, ""Run, don't walk away""
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night, she's screamin', ""I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind""

When she's mean, you know you love it
She tastes so sweet, don't sugarcoat it

I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel

Run that back, Turbo

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
[Verse 2: Gunna]
Yeah, every other night, another dollar gettin' made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (Too hard), charge it to the card (To the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise

Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid

You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they soaked it up, I got 'em glowing
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned it
Stayin' up late, I’ll be awake until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that heat when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, all in hundreds
Vibes galore, cute ones, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young ones run things
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's tense, we ain't runnin'

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You might mess around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' praised
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise

English,27,Someone You Loved,person,Lewis Capaldi,Someone You Loved by Lewis Capaldi,"[Verse 1]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
[Bridge]
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

[Chorus]
For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved",,2019,"Pop

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Verse 1]
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
[Verse 2]
I'm so sorry that my timing's off
But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk
Is it wrong for me to not want half?
I want all of you, all the strings attached

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Bridge]
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing, everything means nothing, babe
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing if I can't have you, no
[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you? (Can't have you)

English,30,Goodbyes,feat,Post Malone Featuring Young Thug,Goodbyes by Post Malone Featuring Young Thug,"[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs somethin' to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say (Say)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart, then you got it (Got it)
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted (Wanted)
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner
[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head (Head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too (Saved too)
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I want you out of my life
I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My heart get possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watchin' the fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered (Yeah)
And I don't want ya to never go outside (Outside)
I promise if they play, my niggas slidin' (Slidin')
I'm fuckin' her, and the tour bus still ridin' (Ridin')
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head (Head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too (Saved too)
I'm no good at goodbyes
[Outro: Post Malone & Young Thug]
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye, bye)
I'm no good at goodbyes
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)

In a Hellcat 'cause I'm a hell-raiser
Self-made, I don't owe a nigga nann favor
When you get that money, nigga, keep your heart
I'm slidin' in a coupe, ain't got no key to start
I got the fire on me in BET Awards
When your well run dry, you know you need me for it
When I pull up in the Buick, you know what I'm doin'
If the police get behind me, I'm fleein' and eludin'
Sleepin' on the palette turned me to a savage
I'm a project baby, now I stay in Calabasas
Like I still serve fiends, like I'm still jackin'
I be sippin' on lean, tryna keep balance
Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks
I don't say much, I just let the heat talk
Your jewelry water whip, diamonds like re-rock
My lil' baby ride the dick like a seesaw
When I stepped up on the scene, I was on a bean
When I jumped up out the Beam', I was in Celine
Baby girl, you just a fling, that ain't what I mean
Money bustin' out my jeans like I do the scheme

You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh
[Verse 2]
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Bridge]
I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (Love of my life)
[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

English,34,Money In The Grave,feat,Drake Featuring Rick Ross,Money In The Grave by Drake Featuring Rick Ross,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, okay
Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it
[Verse 2: Drake]
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)
Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat (Rat)
Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (Limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it (Maybach Music)
[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave

You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothin' new

[Pre-Chorus]
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

[Chorus]
I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless
[Verse 2]
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words, out of my mouth without even tryin'

[Chorus]
And I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

Yeah, baby, mmm
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes
[Chorus]
I'm speechless
You standin' there in that dress
Girl, it ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
Oh, I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness

Every time you walk into the room

English,39,You Need To Calm Down,person,Taylor Swift,You Need To Calm Down by Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night
[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down",,2019,"Pop

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wanting them to see me? I

[Refrain]
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

[Chorus]
Just say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me

[Verse 2]
Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny now?
Now they need me, number one on streaming
Oh yeah, you used to love me
So what happened, what's the meaning? I
[Refrain]
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

[Verse 3]
Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan
But I still want you as a fan
I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands
But I need you to...

Just say to me what you want from me

Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

You a stand-up nigga, I love seein' shit like that

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gon' pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga
[Chorus: 21 Savage]
How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)

Every day that I'm alive, I'ma ride with the stick

Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dog, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really messed me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

[Interlude: J. Cole]
Break it on down, I break it on down
I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six-hour drive, six-and-a-half
Before I left, I stopped by to see my friend 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand-up dude, I love seeing stuff like that

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)

People ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)

I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kinda guy the ladies want
(And there's a lotta cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lotta cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
[Verse 2: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lotta lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lotta lame guys out there)

'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer

I'm a killer, girl, I’m sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don’t get banged
’Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 1: Polo G]
She don’t like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it’s Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer, I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang, that's gon' only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down, better tighten up yo' shoe lace
Lil' bro get up close, let the Glock .22 spray
[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

What you claim? You a lame, you ain't never put in pain (Put in pain)
Swear I be around some killers that go crazy for the gang (They go crazy for the game)
If I showed you all my charges, you won't look at me the same (You won't look at me the same)
Made some choices in my life I wish I never had to make (Wish I never had to make)
Lost my brother, seen him die and I just seen him graduate (I just seen him graduate)
Got that 40 on my side and I'm just rollin' past the jakes (I'm just rollin' past the jakes)
Both my hands can do the job and I ain't talkin' masturbate
I was in and outta state (State) 'cause I had a bag to make (Bag to make)
I risked my life but it's aight 'cause God ain't let me pass away (Pass away)
Fuck tomorrow, spin the block, just know we comin' back today (Back today)

English,46,Beautiful Crazy,person,Luke Combs,Beautiful Crazy by Luke Combs,"[Verse 1]
Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that ""come get me"" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Verse 2]
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, ""Let's stay on the couch and watch TV""
And she falls asleep

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Bridge]
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her
[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak
[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you

We are, we are, we are

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?""
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (Beautiful)

[Verse 2: Khalid]
L.A., mmm
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

Fly (Woo)

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Gucci Mane]
I drink 'til I'm drunk (Yeah), smoke 'til I'm high (Yeah)
Castle on the hill (Well damn), wake up in the sky
You can't tell me I ain't fly (You can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly (I know)
The ladies love luxury (Huh)
That's why they all fuck with me (Woo)

I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Huh, huh, huh
I stay fresh as hell, take a pic, I might as well, hell
Drop the top and take a selfie, my car drives itself
I got white girls blushin', homie, college girls rushin' on me (Woo)
All my diamonds custom so they clutchin' and they touchin' on me
Ooh, think it's vegetables
Ooh, think it's edible
Ooh, it's incredible
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I smell like Bond No. 9 now
Section full of fine dimes
Bitches starin' at me sayin', ""Wow""
Unforgettable (Woo), like Nat King Cole (Huh)
Gucci Barry White, I'm singing to your ho (Well damn)
A one man show (Whoa), a human bankroll (Whoa)
She lost in the sauce (Woo) 'cause Gucci got the glow (Huh)

Big Cuban link, don't need no pendant

Now all my records trendin'
Oh my, I came from stealing bikes to flying on a G5
I don't know why I'm smokin' this cherry pie so much but this my life
I'm on Adderall, I be smellin' Hi-Tech when I piss
Like it's basketball, I drop fifty-pointer on my wrist
It's Lil Kodak, take a pic
I came home and dropped a hit
All these diamonds got me sick, I'm actin' spoiled (Woo)
Cutlass sittin' high (Yeah), I feel like I can fly (Yeah)
So fresh to death, it's crazy, feel like I can die
I done finally got my wings, they make me wanna sing (Glee)

Poor me, pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell nah
I just wanna sip 'til the pain wears off
Poor me, pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't never hurt like this before

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

[Chorus]
I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)
[Verse 2]
Last call
I swear this will be my last call
Now I ain't drunk dialing no more at 3 am
Mr. Bartender hittin' me again

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong

And if I'm ever gonna move on

English,53,God's Country,person,Blake Shelton,God's Country by Blake Shelton,"[Verse 1]
Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings the grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country

[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

[Verse 2]
We turn the dirt and work until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
Then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

(This is God's country)

I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pinewood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country, I saw the light)
Yeah, I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin' (Yeah)
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound

English,54,Be Alright,person,Dean Lewis,Be Alright by Dean Lewis,"[Verse 1]
I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

[Verse 2]
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay
[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

[Bridge]
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

[Chorus]
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""
[Outro]
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

Well, my piggy bank is hungry, my nigga, you need to feed it
If the text ain't freaky, I don't wanna read it
And just to let you know, this punani is undefeated, ayy
He said he really wanna see me more
I said, ""We should have a date—where? At the Lamborghini store""
I’m kinda scary, hard to read, I'm like a Ouija board
But I'm a boss bitch, who you gonna leave me for?
You hoes got no class, you bitches is broke still
I be talking cash, shit, while I'm popping my gold grill
I'm a whole rich bitch, and I work like I'm broke still
Why the love be so fake but the hate be so real? Uh

I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know
Ooh, oh

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
And you say I am held when I am falling short
And when I don't belong, oh, You say I am Yours
And I believe (I), oh, I believe (I)
What You say of me (I)
I believe

[Verse 2]
The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You, I find my worth, in You, I find my identity
Ooh, oh

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
And you say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong, oh, You say I am Yours
And I believe (I), oh, I believe (I)
What You say of me (I)
Oh, I believe

Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure, God, You'll have every victory

All my life, been hustlin' and
Tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a hooker sellin' songs and
My pimp's a record label
This world is full of demons stocks
And bonds and bible traders
So I do the deed, get up and leave
A climber and a sadist, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo

[Chorus]
Hey look, ma, I made it
Hey look, ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
If it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said, ""Hey look, ma, I made it""
[Verse 2]
Friends are happy for me or
They're honeysuckle phonies
Then they celebrate my medals or
They wanna take my trophies
Some are loyal soldiers while
These other thorns are rosy
And if you never know who you can trust
Then trust me, you'll be lonely, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest

Oh, oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go
[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Bridge]
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away

English,63,Beer Never Broke My Heart,person,Luke Combs,Beer Never Broke My Heart by Luke Combs,"[Verse 1]
I've had a largemouth bass bust my line
A couple beautiful girls tell me goodbye
Trucks break down, dogs run off
Politicians lie, been fired by the boss

[Pre-Chorus]
It takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
No, there ain't much, man
That ain't never let me down

[Chorus]
Longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart

[Verse 2]
She was a Carolina blue jean baby
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red taillights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now

[Chorus]
But longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, it takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
But I got one hand
That's grippin' down on a cold one

[Chorus]
'Cause longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars, and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, no
It never broke my heart",,2019,"Rock

Get to roll no
Ayy, I'm in the studio, bro
Oh nah, yeah, call me, ball me
Yeah, I'll
Bet
Yeah, I'm at the studio, hold up, though

[Verse 1]
I ain't get to roll no weed, I ain't get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, I ain't get to see my niggas
I ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time

[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47s, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind (I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind
[Verse 2]
Yellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide
His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him, ""It's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye""
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47s, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind
(I got murder on my mind)

[Verse 3]
Bite like tarantula, bitch, I'm an animal
Melly's a savage, no he not no amateur
Bad bitch named Angela, fucked her on camera
Bitch, I'm a murderer (Yeah, yeah)
I might just kill the boy, don't wanna kill the boy
Bake him up, say he want beef, we gon' grill the boy
(Grill the boy, we gonna grill the boy)
I'm bleeding so good, I might dip his ass in it and spill the boy
Haha, murder on my mind, woah, woah
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind, huh
[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47s, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind
(Murder on my mind)

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 2]
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Bridge]
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Fuckin' on a scammin' ass, rich ass nigga
Same group of bitches, ain't no adding to the picture
Drop a couple racks, watch this ass get bigger
Drinkin' on liquor, and I'm lookin' at your nigga
If his money right, he can eat it like a Snicker

Talkin' all loud in them fake-ass clothes
Fake ass shoes match that fake-ass gold
I'm the realest bitch ever to you snake-ass hoes

I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm lookin' up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees, spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me

[Chorus]
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved (So loved)

[Verse 2]
I've been havin' dreams
Splashin' in the summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice
Crushin' weight of paradise
Solid block of gold, lyin' in the cold
I feel right at home
[Chorus]
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved

[Verse 1]
Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

[Chorus]
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

[Chorus]
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah

My, my air, my air
My, my air, my, my air
My, my air, yeah

[Chorus]
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin', oh, woah

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…
[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful
[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?

Oh, this the one right here, Wicked?
Okay
Yeah, yeah
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 1]
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did
[Verse 2]
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 3]
Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time
[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I’m leaving you (Ayy)
Just dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Drunk to an '80s groove (Ayy)
We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I'm leaving you (Ayy)
Dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Drunk

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
It's only human, you know that it's real
So why would you fight or try to deny the way that you feel?
Oh, babe, you can't fool me, your body's got other plans
So stop pretending you’re shy, just come on and
Dance, dance, dance, dance, oh
[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Early morning la-la-light
Only getting up to close the blinds, oh
I’m praying you don't change your mind
’Cause leaving now just don't feel right
Let's do it one more time, oh, babe

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I’m leaving you (Hurts when I'm leaving you)
Just dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Drunk to an '80s groove (Ayy)
We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I'm leaving you (Ayy)
Dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Drunk

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
It's only human, you know that it's real (Know that it's real)
So why would you fight or try to deny the way that you feel?
(The way that you feel)
Oh, babe, you can't fool me, your body's got other plans
So stop pretending you're shy, just come on and
Dance, dance, dance, dance, oh

This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a two-lane
This radio needs three songs to play
To get me 'cross town to you
That dress needs to slip off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
That's the truth

[Chorus]
Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
""Fishin' in the Dark"" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, me and you, oh

[Verse 2]
Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need a-slingin'
That dance floor needs some me on you
And you on me tonight
Singalongs need to be sung
Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls need a call that cab
And backseats need I want you so bad
[Chorus]
Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls like you to kiss me
""Fishin' in the Dark"" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, girl, me and you

Doors need shuttin'
Lights need cuttin'
Lips need lockin'
Boots need knockin'

Girl you know I've known you forever
How many nights we hung out together
Same little crowd, little bar, little town
Round this old dance floor
My boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder
Making a motion like ""'Could y'all get any closer?""
They wanna know what's up why I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over

[Chorus]
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true?
We make it true
Oh, we make it true

[Verse 2]
Well I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy
I can do whatever you want me to do, baby
Or you could lay one on me right now
We could really give them something to talk about

There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true, baby?

[Bridge]
Oh be honest girl now
Do you want to do this or not?
Should we keep them talking, girl
Or should we just make them stop?

There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, and you feel it too
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
Whatd'you say we make it-
Make it true?
Whatd'you say we make it true?

Let's really give them something to talk about, baby

I see one of my enemies, they gon’ freeze like they cold
I swear I ain't no killer, but test me if you want
You don’t want my adrenaline rushin', leave me alone (Leave me alone)

I'm done hatin' myself for feelin'
I'm done cryin' myself awake
I gotta leave and start the healin'
But when you move like that, I just wanna stay

[Pre-Chorus]
What have I become now?
Lookin' through your phone now
Oh now, love to you is just a game
Look what I have done now
Dialling up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break

Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight

All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight

Love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me, how do you—)

I am not this desperate, not this crazy
There's no way I'm stickin' 'round to find out
I won't lose like that, I won't lose myself

Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll‚ show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Huh? Baby prolly still got them 'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy, on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', ""Baby, please""
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?
'Cause nigga...

English,85,Look What God Gave Her,person,Thomas Rhett,Look What God Gave Her by Thomas Rhett,"[Verse 1]
Don't even want the attention
But, yeah, that's all that she's gettin'
Her song is on and she's spinnin' around, yeah
She got me drunk like Corona
Heart racin' like it's Daytona
Ooh, I'm in Heaven, I swear, right now

[Pre-Chorus]
And those eyes can hypnotize
Was designed to blow my mind

[Chorus]
Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

[Verse 2]
It's like I heard angels singin'
Like she came down from the ceilin'
When she walked in here this evenin', I thought, yeah
That girl one in seven billion
Got everyone in here feelin'
Like there's a fire in this buildin', so hot
[Pre-Chorus]
Got a smile on her angel face
I know I'll never lose my faith

[Chorus]
Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

[Bridge]
Got that look in her eyes
Swear she fell right out the sky
Yeah, I think I've seen the light
Every kiss, I could die
It's like the heavens opened wide
Man, I swear I've seen the light

[Chorus]
Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll, show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy, he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights, I end up meeting all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta, no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suitin' me
Another person tellin' lies on the situation like she knew me
Catch him down bad, that's his loss, it’s you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train, duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can drop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Foolin' around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every guy with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this life really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still dealin'
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sellin'

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Huh? Baby prolly still got them 'bows
I tell my girl I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy, on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these girls showin' love
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them girls' weaves
I'm stallin' girls out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I have her doggystyle, the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', ""Baby, please""
I tell a girl to shut up, you 'bout to mess my vibe up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his shine?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?
'Cause,

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still dealin'

Shorty DM me, I'm straight (I'm straight)
I'm not gon' bite on the bait (Nah)
Sippin' on toxic waste (Mud)
On the low with your girl and it's great (On the low)
Mask on her face, Jason
Run to the set, we in shape (Shape)
If I go broke she gon' leave, escape (She gon')
I put two mill' in the safe just in case, don't go my way (No cap)
My kids gotta have money, not just me (Facts)
That's selfish (It's selfish)
Oh, I took the crown off the king like Mike did Elvis (Oh, I took it)
Ooh, the world is wild, he dying
Don't lie, that don't help him (World is wild)
Ooh, your girl want to eat up the drip, and you cannot help it

[Pre-Chorus: Offset]
Straight out the streets to a penthouse, Miami beach (Yayo)
People talk crazy on tweets (Who)
They don't want it 'cause I come to defeat (They don't wanna)
I peep, these people all sweet (Weak)
Bamboo sticks all in the Jeep (Brr, brr)
There's a new weirdo every week (Weirdo)
Get the whip, put it up for my seeds (Put it up)
No cure for the IG disease (No cure)

[Chorus: Offset]
Do anything for clout (Anything)
They do anything for clout (Anything)
Do anything for clout (Anything)
They do anything for clout (Clout)
Do anything for clout (Clout, do this, woo woo)
They do anything for clout (Anything)
Do anything for clout (Hey)

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Look, whole lotta people need to hear this (Facts)

English,89,One Thing Right,feat,Marshmello & Kane Brown,One Thing Right by Marshmello & Kane Brown,"[Verse 1]
I've cheated and I’ve lied
I've broke down and I've cried
I’ve got nothing to hide no more
I've loved and I've hurt
Broken people down with words
More grace than I deserve, for sure

[Pre-Chorus]
Known to be crazy, known to be wild
Mama had herself a little devilish child
Ain't no stranger to the troubles at my door

[Chorus]
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kinda guy girls' mamas don’t like
Runnin’ with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I’ve been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you

[Post-Chorus]
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Mmm
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Yeah, I got you
(Baby, I got one thing right)
I got one thing right
[Verse 2]
You saw right through my pain
Kept us patient while I changed
Never even crossed your mind to walk away (To walk away)

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was gettin' crazy, reckless, and wild
Actin' like my mama's little devilish child
It took a heart like yours to find its place (Find its place)

[Chorus]
I’ve been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kinda guy girls' mamas don't like
Runnin' with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you

[Post-Chorus]
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Oh
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Yeah, I got you
(Baby, I got one thing right)
I got one thing right
[Bridge]
I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, I got one thing right

[Chorus]
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right (I got one thing right)
Been the kinda guy girls mamas don't like
Runnin' with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you

Oh

Yeah, I got you

English,91,Tequila,band,Dan + Shay,Tequila by Dan + Shay,"[Verse 1: Shay, with Dan]
I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine

[Chorus: Dan + Shay , Dan]
But when I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)

[Verse 2: Shay, with Dan]
I can kiss somebody brand new
And not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory, it only hits me this hard

[Chorus: Dan + Shay , Dan]
When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
[Bridge: Dan + Shay]
I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk and I'm thinkin'
How I need your love, how I need your love, yeah, it sinks in

[Chorus: Dan + Shay]
When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I am a menace, keep me a rack just like tennis
I'm with the shit like I'm Dennis
I started this shit, I'ma finish
Niggas be hatin', tryna blemish my image
Who want the smoke? .223 came with the scope
Extended clip long as a rope
We wipe his nose, just like he had him a cold
I knew that boy was a ho
Pull up with the gang, you know that we bangin'
What is your set, nigga? What is you claimin'?
I am a beast, you cannot tame it
Don't point a finger, this shit can get dangerous
These niggas hatin', these niggas plottin'
Ooh, he got money, I'm runnin' his wallet
You say you a killer, lil' nigga, stop it
In a shootout, your gun was droppin'
You really a fraud, you cannot stomp on this yard
My niggas, they scammin', they swipin' them cards
I am so high that I'm talkin' to stars
I'm gone off them jiggas, I'm poppin' them bars
Don't mind my pimpin', bitch, don't sweat me
Chopper got a kick, call that shit Jet Li
Sauce Gang dripped up, what is your recipe?
Gon' get an F if a nigga try testin' me
Whole lotta money, whole lotta guala
Hit the party fifty deep, nothin' but my shottas
Nigga tried me so you know I had to pop him
So many bullets, it confused the doctor
Whole lotta racks, whole lotta stacks
Fuck a headshot, I'ma shoot him in the back
Three-point-five rolled up in the Cack'
We don't smoke reggie, this shit called gas
I'm sticked up like a blind man
I'm super hot like a frying pan
He say that he gon' take somethin' from me
Ayy, just know, he lyin', man
I'ma up from my hip then blow like a whistle
Your bitch suckin' dick like a Kool-Aid pickle
Two bullets in your chest, that's a nipple
And if a nigga run up, I'ma pop him like a pimple
Get rich or die tryin', I'm feelin' like 50
Brand new chopper got double-D titties
Nigga, don't play me, I don't get silly
Love all the beef like a Southwest Philly, yeah

Girl, I know you had a long day
You ain't feelin' them downtown lights
But I got a bottle at your favorite place
Just waitin' for us in a bucket on ice
Damn, I didn't think it'd be that easy
'Cause now you're gettin' ready
I'm just sittin' here watchin' TV
Here you come lookin' like a grown man's dream
Damn, I can't believe, I can't believe

[Chorus]
I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turnin' on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it

[Verse 2]
Yeah, as cool as it would be
Watchin' people wonder who you are
Oh, we should just say we did, we can start with a kiss
And pretend we just got back from the bar

I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turnin' on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind

Yeah, it's a little cold outside
Music's probably way too loud
To hear you laugh
And there's a look in your eyes
Looks like we ain't leavin' now

I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turnin' on

We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down a coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes
Come to think, I miss them all
And damn, babe, it's all your fault

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Verse 2]
Speakin' of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God, I saw all I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room
[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my)
Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

Don't you remember Times Square?
And people countin' down everywhere
2000-whatever, no, I didn't care
'Cause, baby, you were there
And once again, couldn't help but stare

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah, you guessed it, girl, you know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you

I'm jealous of the blue jeans that you're wearing
And the way they're holding you so tight
I'm jealous of the moon that keeps on staring
So lock the door and turn out the night

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all to myself
To myself

[Verse 2]
I'm jealous of the song that you've been singing
And the way it's rolling off your lips
It might be selfish but I'm thinking
I don't need nothing between you
Leaning for another kiss, yeah

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself, yeah

Girl, I want you in the worst way
Yeah, I want you in the worst way (Mmmm)

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else (No one else, baby)
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall (Paint the wall)
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark (Hide away in the dark)
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself

I'm a motherfuckin' train wreck
I don't wanna be too much
But I don't wanna miss your touch
And you don't seem to give a fuck
I don't wanna keep you waiting
But I do just what I have to do
And I might not be the one for you
But you ain't allowed to have no boo

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause I know we be so complicated
But we be so smitten, it's crazy
I can't have what I want, but neither can you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend)
And I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
But you don't want me to see nobody else
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend)
And I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
But you don't want me to touch nobody else (Nobody)
Baby, we ain't gotta tell nobody

[Verse 2: Mikey]
Even though you ain't mine, I promise the way we fight
Make me honestly feel like we just in love (Love)
'Cause, baby, when push comes to shove (Shove)
Damn, baby, I'm a train wreck, too (Too)
I lose my mind when it comes to you
I take time with the ones I choose
And I don't want a smile if it ain't from you, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Mikey]
I know we be so complicated
Lovin' you sometimes drive me crazy
'Cause I can't have what I want and neither can you (No, no)

And I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
But you don't want me to see nobody else
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend)
And I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
But you don't want me to touch nobody else (Nobody)
Baby, we ain't gotta tell nobody

[Verse 3: Scootie & Ariana Grande]
I wanna kiss you (Yeah), don't wanna miss you (Yeah)
But I can't be with you 'cause I got issues (No)
Yeah, on the surface, seem like it's easy
Careful with words, but it's still hard to read me
Stress high when the trust low (Mmm)
Bad vibes, where'd the fun go? (Oh)
Try to open up and love more (Love more)
Try to open up and love more

[Bridge: Scootie, Ariana Grande & Both]
If you were my boyfriend
And you were my girlfriend
I prolly wouldn't see nobody else
But I can't guarantee that by myself
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend, you ain't my boyfriend)
And I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend, I ain't your girlfriend)
But you don't want me to see nobody else (Nobody)
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend, you know you ain't my boyfriend)
And I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend, yeah, mmm)
But you don't want me to touch nobody else (Nobody)
Baby, we ain't gotta tell nobody (Oh yeah)
You ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend)
And I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
But you don't want me to see nobody else
And I don't want you to see nobody

Takes me back to a better time

And darlin', I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place?

And nobody gets hurt (Don't hurt me, love)

You said you loved me first (First)
One thing my dad told me was
""Never let your woman know when you're insecure""
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
""Flex on a ho every time you're insecure""
I can't see it through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?
[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Don't hurt me, love)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave for my past (Past)
I'm a whole different person (Person)
It's a gift and a curse (Curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Bridge]
You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

[Verse 2]
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs, so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you
[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Don't hurt me, love)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave for my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
